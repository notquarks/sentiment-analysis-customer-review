0_bj,Ilovebennjerry,2017-04-15,3,Not enough brownies!,10,3,"Super good, don't get me wrong. But I came for the caramel and brownies, not the sweet cream. The packaging made it seem like brownies were packed and bountiful *crying frowny emoji* I'd say the taste of this was amazing, but the ratio of brownie to sweet cream was disappointing. Liked it regardless but probably won't buy again simply because it didn't live up to its promising package. I'll find another one that has a better ratio and wayyy more yummy chewy brownies.
Overall, good flavor, texture, idea, and brownies. Not so great caramel/sweet cream/ brownie RATIO. Just add more brownies. Please."
0_bj,Sweettooth909,2020-01-05,5,I’m OBSESSED with this pint!,3,0,"I decided to try it out although I’m not a huge caramel fan, and the first buy was ok, didn’t like the caramel too much and for some reason that specific pint barely had any brownies! Like there were some on top but from the middle to the bottom? Zilch. Nada. Nothing! It was disappointing. But for some reason, I bought it again and I really do believe it was just that point bcuz the second one was glorious!! I had a big brownie chunk in EVERY bite. Plus the caramel didn’t bother me as much and I took a liking to it. Conclusion: I’m on my fifth pint, of the week and I’m going back to get my daily pint cus I’m kinda sick and need some happiness."
0_bj,LaTanga71,2018-04-26,3,My favorite...More Caramel Please,5,2,"My caramel core begins to disappear about half way through. I only buy this for the caramel core. The first time I purchased this I was not even aware that there were blonde bits in there. You had me a salted caramel core, well this is the fourth pint that I have purchased and the caramel is plentiful at the top then it begins to get sparse about half way down at 3/4s of the way down its gone. It works out in my husbands favor because he doesn't care for the caramel so he gets to finish my pint while having a full pint of his choice. Please please please, its called salted caramel core for a reason. Let the caramel flow through the core. P.S. You could put a little extra in there, I totally would not mind."
0_bj,chicago220,2018-01-14,5,Obsessed!!!,24,1,"Why are people complaining about the blonde brownies? If you don’t like blonde brownies, get ice cream with fudge brownies! I LOVE the blonde brownies and cannot get enough of them. This ice cream is by far my favorite. I have driven to multiple stores to try and find it... and when I do, I stock up! I’ve tried other flavors when I can’t find this one, and none of them even come close to making me as happy as this does! I’d say sometimes the caramel to brownie ratio is a little off at times (more brownies please!), but I’ll still always enjoy it nevertheless!"
0_bj,Kassidyk,2020-07-24,1,Worst Ice Cream Ever!,1,5,"This ice cream is worst ice cream I’ve ever tasted. I was beyond excited when I picked it up today and couldn’t wait to get home and try it. First the sweet cream ice cream has no flavour. But that’s fine I could get past that, but the salted caramel core is what’s really wrong. It’s disgusting and so salty it’s actually inedible. I’ve had ice cream before that I have really enjoyed but never to the point where I physically can not stomach it. I love salted caramel but this is just another level. I actually came here to read the reviews and see how others thought of it just in case mine was a bad batch. Never again!"
0_bj,Nikiera,2020-07-23,2,Way Too Salty,3,1,"I bought this last night to go with Louisiana Crunch cake because I was craving that salty and sweet flavor. Unfortunately, I was not thrilled with the salted caramel core of this ice cream. Usually, when you have salted caramel, the salt enhances the flavor of the caramel. The salt in this core OVERWHELMED everything, even the cake. It was disappointing to not enjoy my dessert and I doubt I'll be finishing this pint of ice cream, which is a shame because you should never have to throw away ice cream."
0_bj,Mmelvin,2017-05-28,3,"Love this flavor, but...",3,3,"This is definitely my favorite flavor, but recently, it does not have enough blonde brownie chunks. I'll go through at least half of the pint with just 1 or 2 chunks. It looks like plain ice cream with a salted caramel core. This has happened a lot lately, and it's so dissapointing. I've gotten to the point where I simply stopped buying it. Today, purchased two because they were on sale. It started the way it should be, with plenty of yummy chunks. Before I even got halfway as I was serving myself, no more chunks. After some digging around, I found 3 more way at the bottom. Please fix this! I love this ice cream, but it's pointless without the chunks."
0_bj,Shay10,2017-07-02,3,Really Wanted To Love This,4,1,"I am not a chocolate person at all, and this was my very first time trying Ben & Jerry's, (Shame on me I'm 23 lol) so I was so excited to find a Caramel Ice Cream with BLONDE Brownie chunks instead of fudge. I really wanted to like this ice cream but I just couldn't. The Salted Caramel is a little too salty, In fact, I couldn't even eat the core, I just ate around it. I didn't really like the Sweet Cream Ice Cream, it didn't really have a taste to me, (Maybe Vanilla would be better). The only thing I loved about this Ice Cream were the Blonde Brownie Chunks, They were so delicious! I would love for this Ice Cream Recipe to be worked on, maybe I'll give it a try again in the future."
0_bj,caramel4dayz,2017-07-16,2,Could be better.,8,6,"I LOVE caramel, so much so that I could eat it off a spoon, which was exactly what I was planning to do when I bought this ice cream. Unfortunately this caramel core is way too salty. I actually eat around it! I'm not a fan of the sweet cream ice cream flavor either; vanilla would've worked better. The blondie pieces were delicious but overall I'm disappointed. I really wanted to love this since I love Ben & Jerry's but this was not up to par with their other flavors!"
0_bj,RosaT777,2019-02-12,3,Salted Caramel core had NO CARAMEL,1,1,I love all the Ben & Jerry’s flavor. But recently I been so disappointed of my favorite flavor salted core caramel. It has no core
0_bj,Realeyes,2019-06-02,2,Caramel ended 1/2 way through,0,1,The ice cream really didn’t taste like anything significant and then the caramel which carried the whole dessert ended half way through the cup :( very disappointed!
0_bj,Nicole V,2019-08-23,1,Core went about an inch into the pint,0,2,The core was absolutely delicious for about a scoop of icecream. Then there was no core for the entire rest of the pint. Huge disappointment.
0_bj,deva,2018-02-15,3,good on top...not so good the further down you get,3,2,"I've seen this flavor multiple times at the grocery store the past few months and been tempted, finally pulled the trigger last week."
0_bj,,2018-05-06,1,Oh dear,21,39,"I feel like a dork writing a review for ice cream, but usually a pint only lasts us 3-5 days in our home and we were so disappointed with this one and it's still in the freezer a month later untouched. In addition, I love anything caramel but the salted caramel core was so overbearing, I honestly don't know how this made it on to be a final flavor after the taste testers tried it. It's just too salty. We scooped the caramel into the sink, but then the rest was just a little boring. I will still be a loyal B&J fan, but will be super hesitant when it comes to their caramel line."
0_bj,BJBLU,2019-09-03,3,Why aren’t the brownie bits chewy?,0,1,Hello. I just bought my 4th and 5th pints of salted caramel core while awaiting Hurricane Dorian to arrive. I will have to say that my son and I greatly enjoyed the first 3. Plenty of salty caramel (yum) and plenty of brownie bits that were chewy to the bite. However these last 2 pints that I just purchased do have plenty of caramel and brownie bits but they aren’t chewy. They are more crumbly to the bite. I’m not sure if the first 3 were a fluke or these last 2 weren’t right. Is the brownie supposed to be chewy or crumbly? These last 2 were disappointing for us and makes me question whether we should buy this kind again.
0_bj,Buffaloed,2020-06-24,5,No Regrets!,0,0,"So it's the middle of June and I made an impromptu decision to get a small thing of ice cream during my shopping trip. I initially was thinking of going for a strawberry or peach flavor, but then I saw this pint and had a double take. I'd never try this flavor prior and man, I do not regret it. I love this pint. I love sweet cream and blonde brownie so this was a win-win. I like how to salted caramel is in the center so I have the ability to control how much I want in each bite. I do agree that the salted caramel is a bit on the salty side, but like I said, I have the control to put as little as I want in my scoop."
0_bj,Calla,2018-03-15,5,Perfection!,1,1,"I'll be completely honest, I'm not generally a fan of caramel (it's just too sweet for me) but I gave this flavor a shot because of the sweet cream ice cream. As it turns out, the saltiness of the caramel core perfectly balances out the sweetness! I was pleasantly surprised by how much I enjoyed the salted caramel core. The blonde brownie chunks were also a nice touch and not too overwhelming. I feel like the ratio of mix ins to chunks was nicely balanced."
0_bj,April DD,2020-03-07,5,Wow just wow,0,0,Okay I was expecting an almost too salty weirdly over sweet ice cream but man was I wrong!!! No seriously!!! I started eating this ice cream and was transported to the first time I had gooey caramel pop corn... the ice cream was like eating sweet corn creamy and smooth and the chewy bits supposed to be brownie tasted like caramel pop corn that had gotten chewy and sweet soaked in ice cream.. then the salty caramel center was too good to even say but together the best caramel pop corn ice cream I have ever had.. even though I don’t know if that’s what they were going for lol.. my favorite flavor so far
0_bj,FuzzyGut,2018-06-29,4,"So good, but...",2,1,"This was my 1st pint of Salted Caramel Core but not my first Ben and Jerry’s Core pint. My first impression was that my core was HUGE! It was literally overflowing when I opened the pint! Wow! And the caramel itself was delicious; salty sweet and gooey! The sweet cream ice cream was very rich and cut through the sweet of the core nicely. My only issue was the blonde brownie bits. It’s not that they weren’t plentiful, I just really didn’t like the taste of them, which is sad because the rest of the pint was KILLER! The chocolate brownies in the other flavors are amazingly good so I was disappointed that these blonde ones weren’t very good and I ate around them. So, all in all, it was a good pint with amazing caramel, good ice cream and funky brownies."
0_bj,SaltedCaramelLover,2020-04-01,5,Favorite Flavor!,0,0,"This is my all time favorite flavor. For me it's the perfect combination of sweet and salty and its upsetting to see so many people hate on it. I think vanilla would be too over powering but everyone's taste buds are different. I do agree the blonde brownie bits have been lacking... but I'm an eat the entire pint kinda gal.. oops..sit down to a good movie and this is my go to snack to grab (wish it came in a dairy free option, but I live in WI so I suffer through being lactose intolerant all the time)
So in short, it is sweet and salty flavor. I always have a partial scoop of ice cream to core spoonful I eat and I guess I'm the weirdo that runs outta caramel before ice cream... oops xD"
0_bj,jordan3896,2019-03-03,2,Too much,0,2,I love carmel so much and as soon as I saw carmel core I grabbed it off the shelf. The carmel tastes great and I love the ice cream and blonde brownie pieces in it!!! The only thing that is wrong with it is how much carmel they gave me. It was 3/4 carmel and 1/4 ice cream. It wasn’t a good balance and I probably won’t get it again.
0_bj,CollegeGal,2019-04-14,5,My Favorite Flavor- One of a Kind,1,1,"I always wanted a flavor of ice cream that was tailored to the way my taste buds worked. Most ice cream flavors from other companies that have cookie dough in it is chocolate based, but Ben & Jerry’s has cornered the market: this cookie dough is caramel and butter and cookie based (or blondie if that’s the correct term)! I’ve been buying it almost every weekend at college for a year! Please keep this flavor, it makes me so happy. The fact that there’s a cookie dough flavor that is chocolate free is one of a kind and not many ice companies make that!"
0_bj,Margot,2020-04-19,1,Core more like pencil line,0,1,I was so excited to try the “core” pints. The picture they show online makes it look like a decent size and width. The reality: the core of my salted caramel pint was the width of a pencil eraser tip. Incredibly disappointing and 100% not as advertised. I feel duped.
0_bj,ne26,2018-06-19,3,Core-full?,0,1,"I bought this on sale and was excited to try it. While the ice cream is light and blondies are a nice treat, I wish there was more of a salted caramel core. Mine did not go down even halfway, which is a pity because I love salted caramel."
0_bj,Rileyhd,2017-10-14,2,Not terrible,0,2,I had to buy this to since they were all out of mint at the store...lots of Carmel Core which was a plus but no blondie chunks!!! Any were so tiny...very disappointed because Ben and jerrys rocks!!
0_bj,Pasz,2017-08-15,3,Why,0,2,I love this but where did my core go??????????????
0_bj,TimR,2018-02-07,3,Salty Caramel?,1,0,I know sweet cream ice cream probably wouldn't be a big seller but I wish B&J would make more flavors with a sweet cream base or just a plain sweet cream ice cream. When the flavor was 1st introduced I used to get this regularly but it got to a point I was throwing away most of the caramel because it was too salty. I will still occasionally purchase as there are no other flavors with sweet cream.
0_bj,Cranky Yankee,2019-01-26,3,Too salty,1,0,"Bought this recently because my local target has stopped carrying Blondie Ambition, which was my favorite. I love the sweet-cream ice cream; my container didn't seem to have very many blondie chunks (which was disappointing, see previous) and the salted caramel core was overly salty. It was okay. I might buy it again but would rather have Blondie Ambition."
0_bj,karen511,2017-09-18,2,Ok..,1,0,"I really wanted to like this flavor but it was quite disappointing. Halfway into the pint, the core pretty much disappeared. There was way too much at the top and it wasn't dispersed evenly throughout the ice cream. The caramel was also way too salty for my tastes. Also wished there were more brownie pieces, only found a few in the entire pint."
0_bj,drewmar,2017-09-13,3,Blonde brownies??,3,1,"Couldn't find any in my pint. But the rest is fabulous, don't change a thing!"
0_bj,Tornado7,2018-03-29,1,So disappointed!,1,0,"I had a major craving for ice cream so of course I had to go to the store for some Ben and Jerry's! I was really excited about this flavor, but after a few bites I was gagging. It was too salty and there were barely any brownie chunks :/ I'm really sad this ice cream is going to go waste, but I'm not happy with my purchase at all."
0_bj,Sunrise,2017-07-14,2,Blondie Crumbs,1,0,Just bought this last night and like some of the other reviews there were only a few flecks of blondie. Mine was nothing like the photos. And so the combination of just ice cream and such salty caramel was disappointing and unbalanced. I don't know if the core extended to the bottom since I didn't eat enough to find out.
0_bj,JandM,2018-05-06,2,So Disappointed :(,1,1,"I never thought I would not like a Ben & Jerry's flavor, but it's happened :( When my store didn't have my favorite flavor, I thought I would try the Salted Caramel Core - the description sounded great. Unfortunately, the caramel was *way* too salty - I ended up scooping it all out. The vanilla ice cream was good, but the brownie pieces had no flavor. I've never been disappointed by Ben & Jerry's before, but I guess there's a first for everything :("
0_bj,ASaltyFan,2018-07-07,2,They sure meant it when it said salted,1,0,"The salted caramel core tastes like someone went a little too salt happy. There was just too much core in ratio with the ice cream an in addition to the bad core to ice cream ratio, the core was just too salty to handle. Please fix the core because the ice cream itself with the blonde brownie bits are delicious."
0_bj,elephantsforever3,2019-02-14,1,"Horrible pint, bland brownies",2,2,"I was excited for this ice cream because I love blondies and caramel, but it was the one flavor I've tried that I strongly dislike. The core didn't go deep at all and it was SO salty that it made me feel kind of sick. The brownies were dry and sparce and I barely could taste them. The base was alright, I guess. Really dissapointed. I think this flavor needs to be fixed or just stopped being made."
0_bj,Rudy58,2019-08-12,5,Best B&J Pint ever!,0,1,"I've been hooked on this flavor for more than 2 weeks now. I wish I'd have known about it sooner lol! The Salted Caramel Core is very good and the Blonde Brownies make this product over the top. I do have one complaint though. I buy maybe 4 pints or more a week and everytime I open one and start eating them they are all different as far as how many brownie peices there are or the caramel. Sometimes there's a ton of salted caramel at the top which can be overwhelming and then it's gone half way down. Other times it's normal until you get about halfway and there nothing but the sweet cream ice cream with no caramel or brownies. It's always different, however I'm still in love with this flavor and I highly recommend it! Please B&J see if y'all can get them all the same lol"
0_bj,CollegeGal,2019-04-13,5,My Favorite Flavor,0,1,"I always wanted a flavor of ice cream that was taylored to the way my taste buds worked. Most ice cream flavors from other companies that have cookie dough in it is chocolate based, but this cookie dough is caramel and butter and cookie based (or boo die if that’s the correct term) I’ve been buying it almost every weekend at college for a year!
Please keep this flavor, it makes me so happy. The fact that there’s a cookie dough flavor that is chocolate free is one of a kind and not many ice companies make that!"
0_bj,atik,2017-11-16,3,Too salty,1,0,"The blondie mix ins and sweet cream ice cream were nice, but I really wasn't a fan of the caramel core, because it was far too salty. You've got multiple reviews saying that it's too salty, please don't skim over those reviews. Please consider tweaking the recipe on this one so it's less salty."
0_bj,jessiraes,2018-06-07,2,Good in theory...,1,0,"I usually love salted caramel foods, and I adore Ben & Jerry's decadent ice creams. The ice cream was excellent, the brownie pieces were yummy, but the caramel tasted way too salty! The salt is supposed to compliment the caramel, not overpower it. I'm pretty disappointed."
0_bj,Linda895,2018-04-04,3,Too salty,1,0,"I love anything caramel. I was super excited when I saw the whole core was salted caramel. However it was way too salty, I even tried mixing it with the sweet cream ice cream and it was still too salty. It could also use more of the brownie, which was certainly delicious."
0_bj,Aggs,2017-06-08,5,My all time favorite ice cream!!!,1,1,"I.JUST.LOVE this ice cream!!! if I eat ice cream, it must always be B&J salted caramel core! I think I'm addicted. It's a perfect combination between sweet and salty, plus delicious caramel and chewy chunks. I noticed that some pints don't have that much chunks but the vanilla ice cream itself is pretty yummy and honestly, I cannot stay mad for long haha! If B&J's ever discontinue this flavor, I think it could be the end of my world!"
0_bj,Andrew5,2017-04-12,5,Absolutely fantastic,2,2,"I bought this ice cream simply based on the fact that I was craving caramel. But with this wonderful ice cream, you get so much more. Not only is the Ice cream and blonde Brownies perfect...but the caramel is just so good. You almost want to save the caramel as long as you can because how perfect the flavor is. It's the perfect amounts of sweet and salty."
0_bj,Curt,2018-03-08,1,Way too salty,2,1,"There must have been some sort of mistake with the amount of salt mixed into the caramel. Nobody would but that much saint into a desert. The pint it's still on our freezer. On a side note, Cherry Garcia is the best ice cream ever made."
0_bj,Sheyla1110,2018-03-09,2,SALTY!!!,1,0,Tried this flavor for the first time about two weeks ago it was delicious; But today I’m extremely disappointed. The core is so salty in this pint. I had other people try and they also agreed it was too salty. Don’t think I’m buying again.
0_bj,Margaret,2018-09-07,2,Too salty,1,0,"I am a lover of all things caramel, and while the ice cream and the blonde bites were delicious, I found myself eating around the core because it was just too salty. Tasted like caramel flavored salt. Very disappointed in this flavor."
0_bj,Ohlivia,2017-06-05,5,I love it I love it.,2,1,Salted caramel core is in my top three. My eating tactic is to scoop the ice cream from the outside and then smash the back of the spoon into the core so when I take a bite the first thing I'm hit with is salty and then it's sweet.
0_bj,Atsoli,2018-06-03,1,Horrible!,1,0,"My daughter picked up this flavor for me to try because I love Carmel. I have to say, this is the worst flavor I have ever had. The blonde fudge was bland but the salted Carmel was the worst. It was so salty that I couldn't eat it."
0_bj,Ashley L,2018-09-23,2,Has potential,1,0,"I love Ben & Jerry and was excited about the Salted Caramel Core, BUT the caramel is WAY to salty. I even tried to eat it with more ice cream But the salty flavor is too powerful. Disappointed, I know Ben & Jerry could do better !"
0_bj,GodsGirl69,2017-06-07,2,Caramel core was WAY to salty.,1,0,"Tried this for the very first time today. The caramel core was extremely salty. Way to salty to actually enjoy the caramel. Left a bad after taste.
On a positive note, the core was gooey and easy to scoop out with a spoon."
0_bj,Mpitts,2017-05-21,1,Not a fan of brownie chunks,1,0,I really can't stand the flavors with chunks of cookie/brownie. It seems like I'm eating something stale. I'm in the minority but I stopped going to a convenience store near me because all they carried were those types.
0_bj,Raebirds,2019-01-28,3,Too Salty for my buds,1,0,"I had high hopes for this flavor, but the carmel core was way too salty. I was hoping for a sweeter kraft caramel taste. The blonde brownie bites were just okay...not much traditional brownie flavor. Won’t buy again."
0_bj,Iceicecream430,2018-02-11,1,Don’t buy this one!,1,0,I absolutely love Ben and Jerrys ice cream but this one was horrible. The picture looks like there will be tons and brownies and there were only 5 tiny bites in the whole pint. The caramel core was overly salty too.
0_bj,Kaitie13,2018-09-14,2,Where did the core go???,0,1,"So this used to be one of my favourite flavours! The Caramel is very salty and the blondie bits are very chewy but i love that!
The disappointment comes in the fact that the first few times i got this the core went right through to the very bottom! A thick gooey caramel all they way to the last bite. Each time I have gotten this since I have found the caramel to end sooner and sooner in the pint. This last container the caramel went about half way through .
Please bring back the core!!"
0_bj,Sparky,2017-07-27,3,Core is misleading,0,1,"I enjoyed the of flavor of the ice cream. But I was expecting much more caramel. When the label reads ""Salted Caramel Core"", I expected the caramel to be from the top to the bottom. At least that's what I think of the core to be. Like an apple core, it's in the middle from top to bottom. The core is the center of things."
0_bj,gilderoy,2019-07-12,1,the worst thing to ever be in my mouth,1,0,the caramel tastes like salty death. I think I have sodium poisoning from one bite. Gross as heck like why would you do this to people. Who let this pass the taste test??? Fr fr are y’alls tongues blind?
0_bj,MikeA128,2017-10-30,3,Used to love! Keyword’s “used to”,0,1,"I found the salted caramel core shortly after discovering Karamel Sutra. Needless to say I fell in love! The flavors were amazing and the gooey salted caramel and blondie chunks went perfect together. Until the last 12, yes I said 12! Pints I bought, all fell short. They either had very few brownie chunks, the core stopped halfway through, or there was a pocket of air at the bottom where caramel should have been. I give up! I want my salted caramel, but not at 4.50/pt to be left unhappy."
0_bj,Gabby,2017-10-17,2,Didn't like it,1,0,"I tried this ice cream when it first came out, didn't care for it. It seemed as though it was missing something and I really didn't like the salted caramel. I like the Karamel Sutra much better."
0_bj,klyoliphant,2017-07-14,3,"Good ice cream, too salty",1,0,"The sweet cream and blondie chunks were delicious, but the core was almost too salty to eat. The taste of salt was completely overpowering the caramel flavor. Good overall, just needs less salt."
0_bj,DeeMarieT,2018-08-11,1,Too salty,1,0,The core just tastes like salt with no caramel flavour. The ice-cream was floury & the blonde brownie pieces had no taste. Worst flavour I’ve ever had. Very disappointed. :(
0_bj,Goodduncan,2018-02-21,4,Love this-but need more,1,1,"I purchase this flavor A LOT. Probably too much honestly. I have lived this for a while. Recently the punts seem to be lacking be caramel core to the bottom of the pint and the blondies are missing. There’s like 2 spoons of the caramel and 3 pieces of blondie.
Like I said before, I live this flavor. I just hope the manufacturing can go back to when I first found this flavor and fell in love!"
0_bj,GAPat,2019-06-24,3,Meh!,1,0,The ice-cream is disappointingly tasteless...why not use vanilla. The caramel us too salty and intense...why not swirled? The brownie bites were few and far between.
0_bj,Jade_12,2017-06-19,2,"Brownies good, Caramel not so much",1,0,I love Ben and Jerrys! The brownies and ice cream were very good! The caramel was just overwhelmingly salty. I couldn't even eat it. Maybe it's just not for me. :(
0_bj,Jmask,2018-07-15,1,Very salty,1,0,I had looked forward to trying this flavor but found the core saltier than the ocean. As someone who loves caramel this is the worst caramel I have ever tried. I
0_bj,VJRaye,2017-10-05,2,SALTY!!,1,1,"Typically I love salted caramel desserts (or caramel in general), so when I saw this ice cream I was eager to try it. That caramel core nearly knocked me over with its saltiness!! For me, it overpowered the combined flavor of sweet cream, brownies and caramel. I agree with the other reviewers, vanilla ice cream might have been a better balance. However, I do like the blondies. So close!! :-("
0_bj,Drew C,2018-09-09,3,Almost Delicious,0,1,"the flavors are great and they work well together. Unfortunately, they do not work well with the core concept. The caramel would be much better if it were evenly distributed throughout the ice cream, rather than isolated in one huge pool. The blondies could pack a bit more flavor as well. So far, I have yet to have a variety of Ben & Jerry's core flavors that would not taste better if the flavors were evenly distributed. They almost taste like a cheap Ben & Jerry's knockoff."
0_bj,USAFVeteran87,2017-06-27,2,Great but really salty in the caramel core...,1,1,I bought this favor couple of days ago and thought what could be bad about a salted caramel core. Everything was great except the core was so salty that it drowned out the other favors. I do mean salty the 180 mg are in the caramel core. It left a nasty taste in my mouth. Anybody who needs to watch there salt intake shouldn't eat this ice cream favor.
0_bj,Val3914,2017-06-15,2,Salt core?,1,1,"I bought this the other day and was so excited, but when I tried it, the core was way too salty. I love salted caramel, and all the other reviews rave about the core so I'm pretty confused.. Maybe I got a bad pint but it was like salt with an essence of caramel. Sooo overpoweringly salty; first time I've avoided a swirl or core :("
0_bj,Kmorrow14,2019-11-21,5,Please never discontinue.,0,0,"I don't even understand how anyone could have anything bad to say about this ice cream. The sweat cream base is just the right about of sweet. The salted caramel core is almost bitter on it's own but when paired together they are such a great couple, plus the blondie bites! I am a digger and I never run out of these delicious gems. I will cry If they discontinue this one. For someone that doesn't want an overly sweet ice cream this is perfect."
0_bj,Frankrizzo609,2020-05-12,5,Perfect combination!,0,0,Honestly have no idea why people are complaining about this. There couldn’t have been a better pairing of delicious succulent sweet cream ice cream paired with blonde brownies and topped off with savoring salted caramel to make your taste buds smile with such joy. I’ve been buying a pint every week for the past 3 months and haven’t had the urge to try a different flavor. Please don’t ever discontinue this flavor it makes belly very happy
0_bj,vtmaple,2017-05-04,3,Shaken to the Core,0,1,"My husband was away for the evening, and I felt like a little R&R so I headed to the store for some trusty B&J. I decided to go for a flavor I'd never tried. The description sounded so delicious. And delicious it was! Until, I discovered the core was no more than a dollop on top. At about an inch deep it just vanished, leaving me with nothing but the ice cream and blondies... pretty good stuff, but I'm disappointed at the lack of core."
0_bj,MELA,2018-04-19,2,Too Salty,1,1,"That Salted Carmel Core is WAY WAY too Salty. I tired this when it firs came out and I hate it because it was too salty, but I decided to give it another try to see if the formula had been tweaked.. and nope, it has not. So So SO salty. Like others below, I scooped out the core and ate around what I could."
0_bj,Nick,2017-07-14,5,Great ice cream,1,1,"This flavor is magnificent. The sweet cream ice cream works perfectly with the caramel and blondies. And the blondies are particularly great - soft and flavorful. I'm always scared that this flavor will go to the graveyard. Please, Ben and Jerry's, don't discontinue salted caramel core!"
0_bj,Shelby844,2018-02-21,3,My parents by was disappointing,1,1,"I wanted to try something new and thought this looked delicious. It was REALLY good, but less than half way down the “core” literally disappeared. I mean, the ice cream and blonde chi class were good. But I really bought it for the caramel core and kind of feel like I got jipped."
0_bj,Laydgodiva,2018-05-02,5,THEE BEST HANDS DOWN,0,1,"I LOVE this flavor!!!
I have been addicted to this since 2016!!!
It surpasses anything like it!
I love salted caramel ice cream. However it’s hard finding one WITHOUT chocolate!!!
Chocolate overwhelms the salted caramel for me!
However, salted caramel core gets it right!!!
The blondie bites are the cherry on top!
Please don’t ever discontinue this flavor!!!
If I could afford to purchase every pint, I would!!!"
0_bj,Cami123,2020-06-12,2,I wanted to like it...,0,0,"I really wanted to like this ice cream because I'm a die hard B&J's fan! However it just wasn't that great. The ice cream base was very yummy, it wasn't an overpowering flavor and the blondie chucks were very good! But the center, tasted like pure table salt and sugar mixed. It really was over the top salts to the point where I just ended up eating around it...I wish I would have gotten another flavor if I had known."
0_bj,Leeanette323,2019-05-24,4,What happened to the blondes bites?,0,1,"This was my favorite Ben and Jerry's flavor. I still love the sweet cream ice-cream and I adore the caramel core, but something happened to the blonde brownie pieces. They used to be soft and chewy, perfect texture and delicious. The texture has changed now they are hard and crumbly very disappointing. Thought it was a fluke but the last maybe 5 pints I've had from different stores have all had the same issue."
0_bj,Alli,2017-05-08,2,Delicious brownies but caramel is disgusting,1,1,I bought this last night and was very excited to try. Brownie was great but caramel was so salty that I couldn't even eat it. It was like someone poured a salt shaker's worth of salt into it. Did anyone else have this experience?
0_bj,kpay,2019-05-04,5,SO GOOD.,0,1,"I've already told my husband that I just might cry if this flavor is ever discontinued. And we would need another freezer so I can stock up on pints. To the reviewers saying this mix would be better with vanilla ice cream, you need to check your taste buds! The sweet cream complements the salted caramel core so wonderfully. Although I will agree with others - more blonde brownie chunks please!"
0_bj,katiejanes,2020-08-08,5,THE BEST!,0,0,"This is truly my favorite ice cream flavor! I have introduced several friends to it, and they love it just as much! I introduced my husband to it when we were dating, and we actually had salted caramel core pints at our wedding instead of cake. The salted caramel is perfect for salted caramel lovers, and the blonde brownies are the best addition! I would 10/10 recommend this goodness."
0_bj,Chickenleg,2020-04-10,5,The best thing I’ve ever put in my mouth,0,0,This was the best ice cream I’ve ever tasted. The salted Carmel mixed with the sweet cream ice cream is Devine. When you hit a blonde piece it’s the most delicious mouth watering bite. I would recommend this ice cream to everyone I know. I could live off of this for the rest of my life and be content. I stalked up on these pints during quarantine. Ben and Jerry please sponsor me.
0_bj,RKH123,2020-06-11,1,Salted caramel with emphasis on the SALTED,0,0,"The core concept is great because you get a lot of one key component. I normally love salted caramel. However, the caramel core in this ice cream is so salty I can't eat it. It isn't even a matter of mixing it together with the other ingredients to maybe make it taste better than it does in isolation. The salt just overpowers everything!"
0_bj,SaltedCaramelFan,2017-10-17,5,Excellent blend of flavors,0,1,I’m tempted to give a bad review to see if they “reach out to me to make it right” by giving free ice cream...
0_bj,Angie38,2018-04-29,1,Tastes spoiled,0,1,"I got a pint of this ice cream and i had to throw it out. It had an awful taste and the brownies were really gross and chewy; I spit it out and it left an awful after-taste. I checked the date on the carton and it’s good until 2019, so I’m not sure what happened but the ice cream was the worst I’ve ever eaten. Won’t get that again."
0_bj,Gal Friday,2019-03-18,5,Possibly my favorite flavor!!,0,1,"I'm very surprised by the low reviews on this flavor. It is absolutely delicious. The caramel core is what makes this one so special. You can enjoy it all the way down to the end of the pint. It could use more blondie chunks (bigger ones, too) but this didn't detract enough for me to take away any stars. I LOVE this flavor."
0_bj,Trina,2018-03-05,4,Taste Amazing BUT...,0,1,I love the flavor combo of this ice cream but I just wanted more brownie pieces. I found myself trying to dig out what few pieces were in middle of my pint. Just a little disappointed. I just wanted more :( The overall taste of the ice cream was on point. I don't think a little more brownie chunks will mess that up. Thanks!
0_bj,Jarrett,2017-08-22,4,Almost perfect!,0,1,"Ok so this was my first 'core' Ben and Jerry's. It was awesome. I love the experience of mixing the ice cream with the caramel. But where were the blondies? They were few and far between each bite. I was very excited about it everytime I managed to find a small piece. Also, are the blondies made by Greyston Bakery?"
0_bj,Shotgunshell,2018-01-22,5,Best ice cream in the history of cream!,0,1,My husband brought it home a few months ago and now im addicted! It's so good i as in hospital having brain surgery and it's all I wanted! I give up meals so i can eat it. I don't like chocolate so it's so hard to find blonde brownies and salted carmel without chocolate. If I had a last meal it would be it!
0_bj,PhoenixRises,2019-09-03,5,My Favorite Core Ice Cream!,0,1,"This one is my favorite out of the cores! I'm a lover of caramel and a lover of blondie brownies so of course this is a win! I can't see how the average rating is only 3.5. I don't get it. I don't know what people are tasting, because this is delicious. PLEASE don't get rid of this flavor!! I NEED it!"
0_bj,Christinel,2017-05-25,4,Love salted caramel core!!!!,0,1,"Been buying this since it came out and lately the core has been less and less each time I buy it. The core only goes 1/2 inch and then none. Wish the core would go to the bottom of the container. Please keep the same ingredient but more core caramel!
Would give it five stars with more caramel!"
0_bj,parkesea,2017-11-12,5,SO GOOD,0,1,"I LOVE this flavour. Salted caramel and blonde brownies are my favourite thing, and to find them in ice cream was a dream come true. The only thing I wish was different: I know ""Salted"" Caramel is the name of the flavour, but it really was too salty - so much so that I found it kind of off-putting."
0_bj,Corbin,2017-10-04,2,"Great potential, but lacking in brownies.",0,1,"Tastes great and has so much potential, but the 6 pints of ice cream that I bought-all had a core of caramel with a couple of blonde brownies but nothing like I expected. It fell short of my expectations and I can't justify spending $5 a pint for ice cream that isn't chock-full of gooey goodness."
0_bj,Raee,2020-04-22,3,Finally something not chocolate!,0,0,This was a dream come true when I found it in stores. I was so excited!! I barely made it home. BUT... disappointment hit me in the face when I almost died at how salty the caramel is. Wow. Not enough brownies. I guess I'll keep searching for my perfect flavor. I wish you could Exchange icecream.
0_bj,Jennni,2019-01-24,5,My favorite,0,1,"My favorite flavour from ben&jerry’s! The salted caramel tastes amazing with the cream ice cream and i love the blondie brownies too. I live in europe and they do not have this flavour in finland, which makes me so sad :(
But every time i come to the states i buy it, because it tastes so good."
0_bj,AmandaPanda,2018-09-08,2,Hard Blondie Pieces,0,1,"We have been buying this ice cream since it first debuted. It was our family favorite, hoewever, the last 6 pints we’ve bought have had hard, crunchy blondie bits instead of the soft, chewy pieces we knew and loved. This is such a disappointment and sadly, will make us stop buying this."
0_bj,icecreamfiend,2020-07-13,5,Life changing,0,0,"Truly. I’m in recovery from anorexia nervosa and you better believe that I’ve inhaled a pint of this ice cream every single day!!! The perfect ratio of salted caramel to smooth vanilla ice cream, and the brownie bits provide a nice touch of goodness.
Ben and Jerry’s: 1
Anorexia: 0"
0_bj,jasg517,2019-03-31,4,Tastes Great but Caramel is too Salty,0,1,I got this a few days ago just to try. I really loved it!! The blondie brownies are so yummy. I really enjoyed the ice cream overall. However the salted caramel core was a little too salty for the ice cream. I couldn’t really eat all the caramel with the ice cream like I wanted too
0_bj,Abp87,2020-07-10,5,Can’t get enough of this ice cream,0,0,"This ice cream. Y’all. This ice cream. The perfectly salted gooey caramel, the chewy chunks of blondie... ermahgerd. The worst part of this is we can barely find it anymore. BEN AND JERRY I swear to you if you get rid of this in the middle of a pandemic... I will never forgive you."
0_bj,Ben123,2017-05-20,4,"Really, Really GOOD",0,1,"I am writing this review as I enjoy a pint of this very ice cream. It is delicious and the flavors go very well together. The only problem was, though, that the caramel was waaay too salty, so I ended up eating around it. Nontheless, it was really good and I hope to buy it again."
0_bj,sarah7,2017-10-25,3,good but can use a little help,0,1,I think the sweet cream and caramel are great but I have bought this a couple times and the brownies just are off on taste. I feel like choc brownies would be better or to even leave them out. Far from gross but not as good as other ice cream which is a bummer with the price.
0_bj,Kyure,2020-04-23,5,Perfection!!,0,0,"By far my favorite pint ever! Not to mention, SUPER addicting!!! The blond brownies are the beeeeessst, and with caramel? Truly my only companion in this quarantine, so i stocked up. World War IV could break out and as long as I have my daily B&J pints I’d survive just fine."
0_bj,Jewels30,2017-06-04,1,Caramel Core????,0,1,I bought this for the caramel core the first time and it was great. The second time with was a dollop of caramel on top. The third time an even smaller dollop. If you like just vanillia ice cream a little bit of caramel this is the ice cream for you. I am very disappointed.
0_bj,Newks,2020-04-25,5,It’s my favorite!,0,0,I bought this about a month ago and have gotten two more containers since. I would not say it’s a flavor for everyone but I love it. I love salted Carmel. The salt pairs nicely with the sweet ice cream and blondies! But if you don’t like salty sweetness this is not for you.
0_bj,MicktyMac,2018-12-15,4,Perfect,0,1,"I am allergic to coco beans so finding a tasty ice cream with out any chocolate can become quite the hassle. When I, thankfully, came across this ice cream I was over the moon. The only problem I have with it is that I can't find it in any stores when I go search for it."
0_bj,SadPint831,2018-06-30,2,"Disappointed, false advertising",0,1,"First time buying a pint of salted caramel core. I was so excited! I immediately noticed a lack of blonde brownies and about half way through the pint, the caramel core disappeared. It looks nothing like the picture! There was a total of maybe 5 or 6 blondie pieces."
0_bj,Umpalumpa,2020-09-03,5,Salted Caramel with blonde brownies!!!,0,0,"Salted caramel + blonde brownies + B&J ice cream = what I plan to replace my blood with.
If you LOVE sweet & salty this was made for you. If you haven't tried salted caramel with blondies, Do. It. Now. You have not lived & I weep for you, you poor unfortunate soul!"
0_bj,KirstenBuckeye,2017-08-05,4,"First time wasn't love, second time was love!",0,1,The first time I tried this I thought it was wayyy too salty. I gave it another try a few weeks later and I love it now. The trick is to have a tiny bite of caramel with the ice cream since sometimes the core has a lot of caramel and sometimes it just has a little.
0_bj,Kuhree,2018-12-31,3,Incredibly Sweet,0,1,"I usually get salted caramel core when none of my favorite flavors are available. Even though it's a last resort for me, I still enjoy the sweetness of the vanilla, the chewiness of the blonde brownies, and the incredibly rich caramel. It blend together perfectly."
0_bj,Willcgo2012,2020-04-26,2,"Great concept, salty execution",0,0,"I really love salted caramel and blondes. I think in this pint, though, that the caramel is wayyyyy too overpowering and there are too few blondies to enjoy. I ate around the caramel, but as the core spread through the rest, it ruined the ice cream in my opinion."
0_bj,Anonymous person,2019-10-29,3,Not enough Caramel or brownies,0,0,I think it should be a little more brownies and Carmel all the way to the bottom so you can have a little bit of caramels and brownie with each bite after a few scoops mine didn’t have any more brownies like it was only brownies in the top layer of ice cream
0_bj,Ericb95,2019-01-25,2,Lack of caramel,0,1,I bought this for the first time tonight 1/23/19 and was super excited because I love salted caramel ice cream. Upon opening the product I noticed that the ice cream had no caramel in it whatsoever. Highly disappointed especially for the price of a pint.
0_bj,SlimDaddy,2017-06-15,3,A Caramel Lover's Dream (With A Catch),0,1,"This ice cream is very tasty with the caramel core. However, my core only went halfway through and then stopped. I also wish the chewy bits were a little more flavorful and thicker. Other than being cheated on the core, I really enjoyed this ice cream."
0_bj,Hanna,2019-02-05,5,Best Ice Cream EVER!!,0,1,I have been obsessed with this flavor since the first time i had it! It's all about balancing the sweet cream and the caramel! Too much caramel might be too salty but too much cream might be too sweet. It a balance and extraordinary once you find it!
0_bj,Kaohinani,2019-04-16,5,MY FAVORITE,0,1,"This is one of my favorite ice cream flavors of all time. The caramel is yes, salted! But I personally love the saltier caramel with the sweet creamy ice cream. And the blondie brownies are so YUM! I will be sad if they ever stopped making this one."
0_bj,Jaclyn7,2018-04-21,2,Barely any blonde chunks and core stopped,0,1,I was so excited to try this but I had barely any blond or chuncks in my ice cream and the core stopped half way through!! I thought the core was supposed to to all the way to the bottom. Very upset and this was my first time trying Ben and Jerry’s
0_bj,cdmccune,2019-04-17,5,Best Flavor Ever,0,1,"I love this flavor, it is now my go to! It is the perfect mix of sweet and salty, only sometimes issue is that the core occasionally stops before the end of the carton. It doesn't matter to me though because I still love the brownies in it!"
0_bj,Boommm,2019-11-27,5,Love this ice cream flavor,0,0,This is the absolute best flavor!!!! I love how creamy the ice cream is. The brownies are absolutely amazing full of flavor and very soft!! The caramel is super salty and sweet it's SOO GOOD I'm obsessed. Don't ever change the ingredients!!
0_bj,Shane,2017-07-26,4,Salted Caramel,0,1,"As somebody who grew up on Ben & Jerry's I have been spoiled by so many delicious blends. However, this one was very tasty, but disappointing because the core kept getting smaller until disappearing halfway through and so did the brownies."
0_bj,SarahS,2017-04-27,3,It was good but..,0,1,"I just actually finished a pint of this and while I like the idea and the flavors, it was very off balanced flavor wise. I can't tell if it was just my pint or what but it was overwhelmingly salty with little to none blonde chunks );"
0_bj,Tanya,2019-10-23,1,Disgusting,0,0,"I have loved b&j for many years. My favorite of course which is gone was Wavy Gravy. I bought this flavor because Karmal Sutra wasn't available, this is nothing like it, gagged on the first bite of Karmel SSSOOO salty!!!!!! Yuch"
0_bj,Jan2018,2018-05-12,2,Great flavor but not much of a core,0,1,"Unlike other reviewers, I enjoyed the flavor of the salted caramel. I didn’t find it too overpowering. I just wish the core made it all the way to the bottom of the pint. The pint I ate only had caramel at the very top"
0_bj,Dominique,2018-12-22,5,Amazing icecream but needs a little more brownie,0,1,I brought this so manny times I love it really but the thing about it is that it needs a little more brownie dough in there and honestly I love the Carmel center but it’s just the brownies that need a little bit more
0_bj,Amanda,2017-05-12,3,Where's the rest of the core??,0,1,"I loved this ice cream when I stared the pint but not even halfway through, the caramel core just stopped! I had to be a bad batch because no way that's how it's supposed to be. Sad because that was my favorite part!"
0_bj,Nina,2017-05-08,3,Not enough chunks,0,1,Bought this last night and while the flavor was great there were literally only 5 chunks of blondies throughout the whole pint. I wish there were a lot more as it would have make the eating experience more enjoyable
0_bj,Ice Cream Fanatic,2017-06-26,5,Wonderful ice cream!,0,1,"This is becoming my favorite ice cream, and one that I have come to crave. The only thing that would make it better would be more of the caramel - Ben and Jerry's makes the best caramel in ice cream I've ever had!"
0_bj,Caramel Lover,2020-04-24,1,No Caramel flavor,0,0,"I love anything caramel. Tried this flavor years ago - core was like creamy salt. ! Gave it another try recently thinking it may have just been a bad batch, but again, nothing caramel about it. Will not buy again!"

0_bj,MC Sea Salt Jesus,2020-09-19,5,My Go-to Ice Cream,0,0,I buy this all the time because it's so delicious. The salted caramel and blondies create a tasty melange of awesome flavors. It's my favorite! I highly recommend it!!
0_bj,LillyPad123,2017-07-14,1,Least favorite,0,1,"I bought this last night, the ""core"" barely even went halfway down the pint and there were only a couple chunks of brownie. Didn't even finish it, lacked excitement as all i was left with was vanilla ice cream."
0_bj,naat,2019-08-16,5,ABSOLUTELY AMAZING,0,1,this is the best flavor of Ben & Jerry’s by far. If you’re complaining I don’t trust you; this is seriously the most addicting flavor. If they stop making this flavor I’ll cry. Soooooooooooo goooooooodddddddd
0_bj,AnnArt,2017-08-28,5,Love the caramel core,0,1,"I'm a big salty/sweet fan so this ice cream is perfect for me. I see people complaining about how salty the caramel is, but that's honestly my favorite part about it! Devouring a pint as I type this review."
0_bj,Jadira16,2020-05-11,3,Not so good for the first try,0,0,Today was my first time trying it and I’m a little disappointed I thought this would be “ salty “ but NOT THAT EXTREME SALTY. I wish it was less salty don’t get me wrong I love caramel but this was to much !
0_bj,create_world_peas,2018-09-19,5,Love the salted caramel!,0,1,"Due to health issues, I cannot eat chocolate, so this ice cream is a lifesaver! It's sweet, the caramel is outrageously soft and delicious, and the brownies offer a great bit of texture. I love it!"
0_bj,KayJay,2017-09-22,5,Seriously Delicious,0,1,I think this is my first time writing a review for ice cream. But this flavor is just amazing. The chewy brownies are delicious and I love salted caramel. Perfect amount of salt in my opinion.

0_bj,VanessaB99,2019-01-28,5,Perfection achieved!!!,0,1,This has the perfect example of what salted caramel should be. Smooth and silky with a salt/sweet balance that's downright addictive. Had to force myself away from the carton.

0_bj,KimLovesIceCream,2020-07-15,5,Can’t Get Enough,0,0,I am so in love with this ice cream. Must always have some with me. The sweet cream ice cream combined with the blondie pieces and caramel are a match made in heaven!
0_bj,Theo,2017-12-31,5,Love it,0,1,This one is by far in my top five. I once had a flavor with honey bun pieces and caramel and was obsessed with it but this one by far blows that one out of the water

0_bj,Obsessed,2017-05-27,5,THE BEST,0,0,After trying dozens of flavors this is the one I keep going back to. The caramel core is divine and there's enough to go with every bite. I LOVE THIS FLAVOR
0_bj,Dancer,2017-08-06,2,Not so great,0,1,Very little caramel in the core. There wasn't any caramel until half way down. I've wanted to try the core flavors for a long time now. Won't buy again.
0_bj,BrittaNYC,2018-08-22,5,My new favorite!!,0,1,What’s not to love? I’m completely addicted to this ice cream. I fight with my husband when I feel he’s eating more than his fair share of the core.

1_bj,ChrisColby,2020-03-01,5,"So simple, yet so effective.",11,0,"Ben and Jerry's took the peanut butter/chocolate flavor and knocked it out the park yet again. The peanut butter ice cream is great as always, but combined with the pretzel swirls, the flavor is heightened to an amazing degree. A nice little crunch to the pretzels as well for texture. The brownies aren't quite as good as in other flavors but definitely plentiful and still tasty. Put em all together and you get a salty/sweet peanut butter and chocolate combination that just works. A great flavor."
1_bj,wormmoons,2020-03-31,5,THIS IS THE BEST ICE CREAM IVE EVER HAD,12,1,"The actual peanut butter ice cream is amazing, the brownie chunks taste like they were just cooked. The pretzel bits are the most amazing thing I have eaten, they are not too salty. They are not crunchy or too soft, evert time I get a bite with the pretzel in it I have to just stop and savor it. So far I have only found these at Target I have shared about eight pints in a couple weeks with my husband. Honestly it's the best ice cream I've ever had. Hard, soft, homemade, vegan or non, it's the best."
1_bj,Greenarroweric,2020-04-30,5,Awesome Flavor,3,0,I will start by saying that I'm not a peanut butter flavored ice cream fan(I'm an urban bourbon addict)the only reason I tried this flavor was I couldn't find my flavor. Boy did this flavor SURPRISE me. It's a must try.
1_bj,KirstenBuckeye,2020-07-13,5,Sweet and Salty Perfection,2,0,My top two favorites of all time are Tonight Dough and Chubby Hubby (tied for first place) and a close second place is Netflix & Chill’d! The brownie pieces were HUGE and the salty sweet combo was just perfection.
1_bj,Naughtytink,2020-02-17,5,Perfect ice cream!,9,0,"This is EVERYTHING I want in ice cream! Peanut butter, sweet, salty & just enough chocolate. I hope it becomes a regular flavor."
1_bj,bluejaysfan_1975,2020-06-08,4,Love it!,0,4,"I love the PB ice cream rather than another flavour with gobs of actual peanut butter* throughout the pint**. The saltiness of the pretzel and chewy bits of fudge make tis quite possibly my new fave-flave. But...Everytime I look at the red couch on the label i can't help but think of tomatoes and thats not a flavour combo I wanna try anytime soon.*** Yuck!
* Don't get me wrong, I loves me some PB gobs but we got enough of those.
** I know that its not a pint here in Canada. But it sounds better than ""2 cup tub o' B & J's""
*** If there IS a Tomato ice cream with chunks of marzipan and marshmallow swirl flavour in the works I'd beg you good folks to reconsider."
1_bj,ambitious07,2020-02-05,5,Amazing,8,1,I am in love with this flavor. I'm a big pb fan and it is very prominent.
1_bj,Netflixchilledlover,2020-04-03,5,An ALL TIME Favorite!!!!!!,3,0,"This is just simply amazing. I am not one for ice cream but this has changed my perspective, so many perfect flavors wrapped into one. Sweet yet salty, enough toppings in every bite. WOW! I look forward to this every night!"
1_bj,AFerg,2020-06-17,2,Way too salty,2,0,"The peanut butter flavor is good and the ice cream is creamy, but the balance of salty to sweet is way off. This tastes like peanut butter ice cream with pure salt swirled through it. The brownies are soft but flavorless, so they do nothing to help balance the flavors. I normally love salty sweet combinations, but this missed the mark."
1_bj,,2020-08-28,5,All the best flavors in one,0,0,"The peanut butter, the brownies and the pretzels all together!! So good, perfect amount of sweet and salty. I need more!!!!!"
1_bj,Grover15,2020-08-13,5,Delicious!,2,0,"This flavor was AMAZING. I would not change anything about it! I never thought I would find anything better than Half Baked and Tonight Dough, but this flavor definitely made it up there with them."
1_bj,Icecreamdream17,2020-07-03,2,Underwheming,2,0,I was really disappointed in this one. Flavors were blah. The peanut butter icecream tasted more like vanilla and hardly any pretzel flavor. Chubby Hubby is a much better choice with similar concept
1_bj,HBunny,2020-04-21,3,Unique treat,2,0,"Salty and sweet, but could use more brownie chunks and pretzel swirls to achieve sheer perfection! The concept is there but my pint had paltry mix-ins."

1_bj,Kitchen82,2020-05-14,5,Best flavor ever ( please make permanent ),0,0,"The first time I tried this I was in love, it's the perfect peanut butter flavor with the perfect amount of sweet and salty, it's amazing & the chocolate brownies add just the right amount of chocolate. I've bought probably 16 pints so far, maybe more. I'm in love!! I look forward to my treat at night and I dont know what I'd do without this flavor. Please please please #Ben&Jerry's dont ever take this one away, Netflix & chill'd needs to become a permanent option. I'll be so sad if y'all stop making this one."
1_bj,Mokarran,2020-02-23,4,Pretty good!,2,1,"Great pb flavor! Love the salty pretzel swirl! But the brownie pieces were too big and chewy, like a dog eating pb. I think I’d prefer it with a fudge swirl and larger pretzel pieces. Will try it again, maybe it will have smaller brownie chunks. Peanut Butter World is still my favorite."
1_bj,Carmalina,2020-09-11,5,New Favorite for Ice Cream Addict,0,0,"I bought a pint of this when it first came out and I ate the whole thing in one sitting. And another the next day. And another the next... this is my FAVORITE flavor, even better than any I've had from any specialty ice cream parlor. It's the epitome of sweet and salty. The pretzels are almost more like sprinkles of salt with a bit of texture, the fudge brownie is dark and rich enough to break up any monotony. I don't want this to ever go away (even if it's responsible for 90% of my quarentine weight gain) :P"
1_bj,Kkcott,2020-03-31,4,Needs more brownie,4,3,I got the chocolate fudge brownie and yes there is a great amount of brownie but I think the ice cream to brownie ratio should be more brownie less ice cream!
1_bj,Lexa,2020-04-08,5,Bomb Bomb BOMB dot com,1,0,B&J did it again. The creamy smooth texture of the peanut ice cream contrasted with the swirl of salty pretzel goodness engaged with nice healthy chunks of brownies. Perfect combination of flavor and texture. Thank you B&J for making another wonderful creation. You guys rock!
1_bj,gabby606,2020-05-31,5,Simply amazing,1,0,I finally got around to trying this flavor and I’m so glad that I did! I’ve been buying Ben & Jerry’s for the past 15+ years and this is one of the best flavors I’ve ever had. The flavor of the peanut butter ice cream itself is incredible. I’m thoroughly impressed.
1_bj,Tcrave,2020-03-29,3,Way too salty,4,4,"Honestly I think maybe I just got a bad one from the grocery store. The flavors were good but it was just SOOOO salty. I will probably try it again though, hopefully it was just a goofed pint"
1_bj,mc12345,2020-06-23,1,"Too salty, not sweet",3,3,"This was the worst ice cream I’ve ever had. Peanut butter flavor mixed with pretzel is way too salty. There is almost no brownie, and the brownie pieces have no flavor. This would have been better if it was chocolate ice cream or chocolate fudge mixed in."
1_bj,AnabolicAlbert,2020-06-17,4,Sweet N Salty,1,0,"Peanut flavor is exceptionally bold and delicious, however the saltiness is oddly mixed in, I’ve had bites of mild salty pretzel and really really salty bites. Could do a little better in that regard."
1_bj,Marise,2020-04-29,5,My Favorite flavour,1,0,I bought this 3 days ago and just bought a second tub! Its absolutely perfect. I love the salty swirls and the brownies are soft and delicious. Please keep this flavour!
1_bj,TJSmith,2020-06-09,1,Not good.,3,3,The peanut butter ice cream was chalky and salty. The brownies were made with a very bitter chocolate. The pretzels were in a mushy mass and did not look appetizing. This was probably the only B&J ice cream I have not liked.
1_bj,suzi,2020-06-22,1,"Not very good, sorry",3,6,"I am a fan of peanut butter cup and cookie dough, and birthday cake. But I think this one is too much. A simple peanut butter flavor with brownies and why not bananas would have been enough. Why the ""pretzels""? It tasted like uncooked dough. at least put real pieces of mini crunchy pretzel. I'm even surprised netflix associated their name to this ice cream :("
1_bj,Katty1002,2020-06-10,5,Best Ice Cream Flavor!,1,0,"Just tried this flavor and it’s officially my favorite! Perfect balance of sweet, salty and savory. The little bits of fudge are also SOOOOOOO GOOD! Can’t get enough"
1_bj,Weimerallie,2020-03-19,1,Soooo Salty. Yuck,10,20,"Not a fan of this flavor at all. Seemed to have the makings of an awesome icecream with all sweet and salty components, however, the pretzel swirls were so salty it made me gag. 0/10 would not recommend"
1_bj,SteveInChCh,2020-06-21,1,One of the worst tastes ever,5,6,"I really enjoy different ice cream flavors, but this is just disgusting."
1_bj,ogremach,2020-04-24,3,"great flavor, gritty texture",1,1,"Looked high and low for the new flavor and was excited to try (peanut butter is my favorite). The flavor of the peanut butter ice cream was not overpowering as I was concerned, but pleasant. I was disturbed by the texture of the ice cream. It felt gritty and the brownie batter swirl had a taste like chocolate, but was the consistency of taffy. Not my favorite flavor."
1_bj,dino19,2020-07-10,1,Not my favorite flavor :(,1,1,"I’m eating this now, and it’s getting harder and harder to eat. The pretzel swirls are strangely too salty and the brownie pieces are too mushy. The peanut butter ice cream is okay. The combination of everything together just doesn’t work for me. Maybe it needs some texture? Some crunch? I still love you, Ben & Jerry’s!! I’ll stick to Phish Food and Gimme S’more."
1_bj,Shar,2020-03-29,5,Great!,1,0,Amazing flavors and amazing taste. One of my top 3.
1_bj,RedCoyote,2020-04-29,2,Salt Explosion,2,3,"If you, like a horse, enjoy licking salt... than this is the ice cream for you. I really wish that the brownie parts were bigger and more brownie like. Also the pretzel dough bites are more like bits of playdough when it comes to flavor, and the added saltiness. Good Idea on paper, not so much in taste."
1_bj,Sammy,2020-06-24,1,Nope,3,3,"How did Netflix approve this flavour? It’s been in my freezer for days, which never happens :/"
1_bj,,2020-04-11,5,Honestly,0,0,"I bought this for the first time a few months ago, and wow. I was floored. This icecream is the most perfect balance of flavours ive ever experienced in a BJ pint. It is salty and sweet, but not too sweet as I find many BJ flavors, and not too salty."
1_bj,RoyK,2020-04-23,1,Anticlimactic,3,6,"I was excited to buy this flavor but was quickly disappointed. To me the brownies tasted of rye bread, the ice cream was gritty (not in a good way, either). There was flavor of pretzel but I saw no pieces. I will probably go back to Phish Food next time."
1_bj,Sydsscoops,2020-05-27,3,Great concept that needs some tweaking in the lab,1,1,"I wanted to love this flavor. What’s not to like? Peanut butter ice cream with pretzel swirls and brownie pieces—should be a hit. It is not. First, the peanut butter ice cream is WAY too salty. I agree some salt is needed to offset what could otherwise be a cloyingly sweet peanut butter flavor, but this kills any semblance of peanut butter flavor and is unnecessary given the pretzel swirls. Second, why pretzel swirls and not pieces or chunks? The swirls are weirdly soft and barely evoke the sense of eating a pretzel. Finally, the brownie chunks were just weird. They are the same ones as in Half Baked, where they work beautifully. Here, I respect the need to bring in a chocolate component with a peanut butter base, that’s a no-brainer. But why not go with fudge chunks or chips? The brownies brought no flavor to this pint and certainly did not help on texture. A slight re-tooling of the flavors and components would probably make this the ice cream dream the description promised."
1_bj,Markhardman,2020-03-29,1,To much salt nasty,6,11,Tried it for the 1st time wont ever buy agian way to salty.
1_bj,,2020-05-12,2,A true review,2,5,"This is probably one of the worst Ben and Jerry ice cream I’ve ever had. I love Ben and Jerry I’ve cream, but this one is just plain bad."
1_bj,rayray96,2020-04-09,5,I am building a shrine to this flavor,1,0,"Okay, so when I saw this flavor first advertised I was out of my mind excited. I love peanut butter. I love brownies. And I love pretzels. But when I finally tracked it down in stores, I was disappointed because it wasn’t what I was expecting it to be. (Also, it melted a lot on the way home that day.)"
1_bj,Lexi143,2020-07-28,3,It's Okay...,0,0,"This flavor has such a fun name and sounded amazing, so I recently purchased it. It's not bad by any means, but I found myself wishing there was more sweetness and/or chocolate throughout it. I found the peanut butter and pretzel combo made it a bit on the saltier side, and it would have been nice to have some additional sweetness (like a caramel swirl or chocolate ice cream mixed in) to balance it out a bit more."
1_bj,Not Tryna be a Karen,2020-07-21,3,Missing the mark.,0,0,I love the peanut butter ice cream base. Very delicious and unexpected.
1_bj,Lukas,2020-06-10,1,Worst flavor I’ve had,2,2,Probably the worst B&J’s flavor I’ve ever tried. What a waste of calories
1_bj,Hdg3327,2020-06-19,5,This ice cream is the chip!,0,0,"Bought this as soon as I saw it in store last week. If you don't like sweet and salty stuff, this is not for you. As other reviewers said: I enjoy the milk chocolate, lighter, ice cream with chocolate chunks. The ""chips"" come in little balls and are surprisingly cripsy and chip tasting. I hope they add these as a permanent flavor! The people who don't like it probably also don't like pineapple on pizza .."
1_bj,rayelle,2020-05-15,2,Intense,1,1,"The peanut butter flavor was overwhelming to me and the salty pretzel swirl just layered on the intensity. However, i feel if there were more brownies throughout it would balance out. They all seemed to be clumped into the bottom of mine."
1_bj,Sebs2020,2020-06-11,5,Great Combination and Interesting Textures,0,0,"This has been my go-to flavor for the past month. The flavors go together really well, finding a perfect balance between the peanut butter, the pretzels and the fudge brownies. Another great thing about this flavor is the texture that it has which is pretty unique. Every bite you'll find a juxtaposition of the grainy pretzels and soft fudge swirls,. A truly delightful experience for the tastebuds!"
1_bj,AngelinaNotAngie,2020-06-11,5,Netflix and Chill’d is my new favorite flavor,0,0,"It’s so good. The brownies are legitimately delicious as brownies, not brown blobs like other brands. The peanut butter ice cream and pretzel streak compliment each other. So good. I might give in and have it for breakfast today..."
1_bj,bananni,2020-03-07,4,Great PB Flavor!,1,1,Everything about this ice cream is amazing...except the brownies. They remind me of the cheap cosmic brownies you can get at the grocery store. The pretzel swirls are so tasty with them PB ice cream though!

1_bj,jwl2020,2020-05-13,5,May be my new favourite,0,0,This... is so good! I think its a perfect combo of salty and sweet; Didn't think I was too much of a peanut butter fan but this tastes so good honestly. I think it might beat Baked Alaska as my new favourite! PLS PLS PLS don't get rid of this flavour I know it's probably a limited edition or something but just rename it to something else without the Netflix.
1_bj,Lindseysprout,2020-08-04,1,Too salty,1,1,I am a life long fan of Ben & Jerry's and love most so flavors. This is the only one that I could not eat. I had to throw it out. The main problem was that it was way too salty.
1_bj,dubweisser,2020-05-14,5,"Love it! However, weird question...",0,0,The flavors and textures work beautifully together. This is an extremely satisfying ice cream for my palette.
1_bj,ReganRex,2020-05-26,1,What the heck were they thinking!?,1,6,"This is a terrible ""ice cream"" - I opened the pint, ate the bit stuck to the top of the lid and gagged so hard. How do you make peanut butter ice cream tasted like crushed hopes and dreams!? I'm so irrationally angry at this pint of ice cream I may never buy B&J's again... The only flavor I ever loved anyway was the creme brulee..."
1_bj,Sleas_az,2020-09-21,2,Meh...,0,0,"I do KETO and this was my treat for my carb load day and I have to agree with another review that the pretzel pieces reminded me of eating sand...or KETO almond flour. Lol Alzo the brownie portion was sticky so it kept sticking to my teeth in am awkward way. Def not my fav flavor, sorry."
1_bj,NicM,2020-07-15,1,WAY too salty!!,1,1,I only had one piece of fudge and no pretzel bits! It was just pretzel crumbs & salt chunks in the middle. Sooooo dissappointed. :(
1_bj,Geo85,2020-08-18,1,Flavor= Salt,1,1,Salt poured onto gross flavorless ice cream ... seriously not much else to say. Waste of money. Please go with other flavors.
1_bj,jaylene,2020-08-22,5,New Favorite B&J Flavor!,0,0,"Can we take a moment to appreciate the delicious pretzel swirl in this, I need that in all my ice cream now! Such a great combination of flavors, the peanut butter ice cream is spot on and how Ben and Jerry's keeps their brownies so soft and fudgy is a miracle in itself. Love this flavor, so happy it looks like it will be a permanent flavor to the line!"
1_bj,elliot01,2020-05-17,2,too much salt,1,1,"About every few bites, there is a clump of salt that tastes disgusting and feel likes you're biting sand."

Honestly, i've discovered it during quarantine because i could not find my flavor at the grocery store. Sweet and yet salty; mix of texture really i am obessed and you should definitely trying ! This is my first time writing a review for something but really it is so wooooorthy !"
1_bj,eliz13413,2020-06-13,4,"Very tasty, however...",0,0,"I LOVE anything with peanut butter and pretzels, and this point delivers that in an excellent way. I don't care for the brownien pieces, however. They're too big and don't taste very good. I think small pieces of chocolate fudge would work a lot better. This will not stop me from buying more of this flavor, though, that is for sure!"
1_bj,Andrew1989,2020-09-20,1,Tastes like salty nutty sand,0,0,"I don't know if it was just my pint, but the chunks of pretzels were so small it was like eating sand that stuck to my teeth. I got this pint because I couldn't find my original pint Justice remixed anywhere, and I really regret it."
1_bj,Bmp87,2020-04-27,3,Meh,1,3,Was so excited about thia flavor. The peanut butter ice cream and pretzel swirl is bomb but my pint had 0 brownies!!! They need to rethink the final product. Its lack lust.
1_bj,YouAreSalty,2020-06-19,5,It’s not salty bro!,0,0,"I’m not a big peanut butter and chocolate fan BUT The peanut butter is so subtle in this icecream and with the pretzels it creates a dream and balances out the brownies. It’s amazing, I thought the tonight dough is my favourite but this is giving it a run for its money in my favourites"
1_bj,Bambooninja,2020-06-11,4,Wonderful peanut butter flavor,0,0,I bought this to complement some chocolate cake. The peanut butter flavor is fabulous. The salt from the pretzel enhances the flavor. I'm on the fence about the brownie because I found it a bit gooey. Brownies are a good idea but maybe make them smaller and more chewy.
1_bj,SweetNSalty,2020-09-01,5,Great Taste!,0,0,"I've seen a few people complain about the saltiness. Pretzels are salty and it might not be the flavor for you. However, to those of us who love pretzels, peanut butter, and brownies: This is a GREAT flavor for those of us who like the sweet and salty mix of flavors!"

My husband doesn’t usually eat dessert and the first tub we bought, I had a single, humble scoop, only to find out the next evening that he had finished the pot. I wish I had a bigger freezer."
1_bj,,2020-08-31,4,I've Bought it Three Times,0,0,"Peanut butter and then the juxtaposition of the salt in the pretzels. So...read the review title and that's pretty much all.

1_bj,givemethecream007,2020-05-07,4,Golden ratio ice cream,0,0,"The peanut butter ice cream is deliciously rich and creamy. The brownie swirls are gooey and proportional with every bite, which pairs so well with the ice cream. The pretzels add an awesome touch to a balanced sweetness, salty and not too crunchy."

Absolutely love this flavour, they have again delivered a master piece"
1_bj,TommyG,2020-08-05,3,Interesting blend of flavors,0,0,The Peanut Butter flavor is very good although the fudge seems out of place and rubbery. The salted pretzel is a nice compliment to the PB but the overall blend of flavors reminds me of a PB&J sandwich. OK but not amazing.
1_bj,sarah123,2020-06-11,5,MY MOST FAVORITE ICE CREAM IN THE WORLD,0,0,I love this ice cream and the pretzel swirl is my favorite thing. I've been waiting for B&Js to come back with this flavor. I like how salty it is. I've bought many to make sure I am stocked up. Please keep this flavor!
1_bj,Bloomable,2020-06-07,5,It’s just Amazing,0,0,This ice cream is so delicious. As soon as I tasted it I knew it would be a regular in my ice cream rotation. It’s the perfect mixture of salty and sweet and the flavors are just balanced really well. Highly recommend.
1_bj,haley123,2020-08-25,4,SO good,0,0,Sunday cheat night arrived and I already knew exactly what I was gonna do with it. This ice cream is delicious - the only reason I gave it four stars instead of five is because I wish it had more pretzels/saltiness.
1_bj,BreG,2020-08-07,2,Where’s the Brownie?!?!,0,0,"Love the peanut butter flavour and the sweet and salty preztel swirls. Great for peanut butter lovers! However, I was disappointed that my pint did not have a single brownie bit, as mentioned in the description."
1_bj,Goon Squad,2020-05-27,5,Best flavor of all time,0,0,I truly haven’t ever had an ice cream I like as much as this one. It’s creamy and has hunks of fudgey brownie with the salty peanut butter and pretzel pieces. I’m obsessed and I request a lifetime supply.
1_bj,kw81,2020-04-02,5,Great for PB lovers,0,0,"I got a pint a few weeks ago and was blown away. For the first time, I found an ice cream with a decent peanut butter flavor. The salty pretzel swirl adds a nice little flavor boost. I need more!"

1_bj,KayDee,2020-09-13,5,BEST ICE CREAM EVER,0,0,This is the best ice cream I have ever tasted. It is the perfect blend of salty and sweet. Please please please Misters Ben and Jerry make it a full-time product instead of a limited flavor.
1_bj,Rehab Radio,2020-04-09,5,NUMBER ONE,0,0,This ice cream is heavenly. I have never written a review for ice cream before but this particular flavor was LIFE ALTERING..PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE send more up to the Central Maine area.
1_bj,dejofran,2020-08-14,3,A bit too salty and not enough brownies,0,0,I would’ve loved more brownies and crunch pretzels. I liked the swirls but it was a bit salty. I’d choose chubby hubby over this one. I did enjoy the peanut butter ice cream.
1_bj,Luandjoe,2020-06-06,5,Wow just wow - pretzels where u at,0,0,Delicious. Tastes like a peanut butter party on my tongue. Lots of brownie came through but the pretzels didn’t get the memo. Hopefully they come round in the next bowl

2_bj,chelsealovesicecream,2020-05-13,5,BEST flavor EVER,22,8,"During quarantine I was living off of Half Baked...but when I went to the store all that was left was Chip Happens. Having been heartbroken by another brand's ""Milkshake and Fries"" I reluctantly bought Chip Happens. I am happy to report Ben & Jerry's NAILED this flavor. The lighter chocolate, chocolate chunks and the perfectly CRUNCHY salty potato chip swirl is EXACTLY what every sweet/salty craving is made of. I put on my quarantine mask and went back to the store and bought the 4 pints left. I need another freezer to stock this flavor. Hope it remains a regular flavor because it says ""limited botched edition"". Break quarantine and RUN to get Chip Happens!"
2_bj,horix,2020-07-12,5,"Please, never get rid of this potato chip flavor!",10,6,My favorite flavor used to be Late Night Snack because of the amazing innovation of the salty potato chip balls they used in combination with the sweet ice cream. The combo is heavenly. I've been waiting for years for Ben and Jerry's to bring back the potato chip ingredient and lo and behold yesterday at the store I found this flavor. It's even better than I remember late night snack being; the potato chip swirl provides a perfect salty and sweet combo in almost every bite. Please make this a permanent flavor; or at least release something else that uses this potato chip ingredient because I'll be SO sad if I have to wait years for it to appear again.
2_bj,Skelly,2020-07-22,5,Perfect Combo!,9,1,"Please keep this as a permanent flavor as I've introduced this to others and we all LOVE it! Just like as a kid putting chips in my peanut butter and jelly sandwiches, this ice cream is the best thing since then! Love the chocolate ice cream with the chips!! Would love if you kept it around!!! Was bummed when I saw it was a 'limited botch'
Thank you!!!"
2_bj,,2020-07-26,4,Love this flavor combo!,5,0,"I tried this for the first time a few days ago and the pint is already gone. This is a perfect flavor for someone that likes the sweet and salty combo (e.g. chocolate covered pretzels). The chip pieces add a nice twist to the chocolate, and the texture/consistency is not weird. There are some bites that I feel the chip chunks are a little too big,but overall it is great!"
2_bj,chipalwayshappens,2020-07-21,5,Best B&J's flavor!,4,1,"I am a lover of all things sweet and salty, so when I saw this in my grocery freezer I just knew I had to try it. Ben & Jerry's did NOT disappoint with this flavor! I've searched for and bought this flavor countless times since I first found it a few months back, and I enjoy it a little more each time. The sweet & salty balance in this one is perfect. The only downside I can say is that the consistency of the potato chips are often in botches and not evenly distributed throughout, but that's nothing some scoop controlling can't fix. Please keep this one permanently!"
2_bj,Sierrastdenis,2020-07-19,5,Amazing!,5,5,"I was so excited when I saw this flavor! I am usually picky with different ice cream flavors. Ben and Jerry’s used to have a flavor that was called The Kitchen Sink...I believe, which was vanilla ice cream with chunks of potato chips mixed in! It was my absolute favorite! I was so upset when it was discontinued! When I found this ice cream I was SO EXCITED! I’m hoping this will become a permanent flavor!"
2_bj,Sydsscoops,2020-07-19,5,Should be a permanent flavor,31,7,"This achieved what Late Night Snack could not--it is a FANTASTIC flavor. The chip swirls have the perfect salt content and potato taste. They stay crispy, which is a great complement to the thin crunch of the chocolate chips and that smooth, almost milk chocolate ice cream. THIS SHOULD BE A PERMANENT FLAVOR. IT'S SO GOOD."
2_bj,MJamz,2020-05-01,4,Chip Chip Hooray!,5,7,"Fresh off the taste test, I'd say this was a great addition to the flavor line-up! It's simple but different enough from the usual B&J's components (although those are great too!). I appreciate that the base is a bit of a lighter, milkier chocolate-- more like in Chocolate Shake It than Fudge Brownie. The potato chip swirl is fantastically crunchy and salty. I'd love a real mish-mosh with a split between chocolate and vanilla (or peanut butter), and BOTH the chip and pretzel swirl (like in Glampfire Trail Mix)... what botch heaven that would be."
2_bj,JLI7,2020-07-30,5,Blissful Contrast,2,0,"I am not usually the type that likes a lot of mix-in’s in my ice cream, in fact, it would be accurate to call me a plain Jane. However, I just recently happened to go on to your website and saw that this was a new flavor so after a trip to the grocery store......my palette my most pleased. It was such a wonderful combination both with the velvety chocolate ice cream and then the salty crunch of the potato chips!! Well done———-you most definitely nailed it!!!!!"
2_bj,AthenaDog830,2020-07-24,1,Can NEVER compare to Late Night Snack,6,6,"I have no idea why this has so many good reviews. This is a HORRIBLE flavor!! Bring back Late Night Snack before you bring back this GARBAGE. Late Night Snack was the PERFECT balance of salty and sweet. The chocolate covered potato chip balls and caramel were so so good!!
I love chips, but these are WAY too salty. The chocolate ice cream was a horrible choice, vanilla would have been better.
I have no idea how this even got made or why people like it. I am so so disappointed in you Ben and Jerry's. DO BETTER!!!"
2_bj,JayIceCream,2020-05-13,3,Bring back Late Night Snack!,5,3,"Can I express how excited I was to see this on the shelves? I was beyond excited since I was a HUGE fan of Late Night Snack. Upon opening the lid, I noticed chocolate ice cream with giant chunks of chocolate chips and potato chips.On my first bite, I tasted molasses and then bits of chocolates and potato chips. I wasn't a fan of the strong taste of molasses.. Perhaps I was expecting something similar to the discontinued Late Night Snack. Chips Happen wasn't bad but it wasn't great."
2_bj,LAloveschips,2020-08-08,5,Please keep this as a permanent flavor!!,0,0,"Simple and delicious flavors with great texture! The potato chip stays crispy, and it works great with the size of the chocolate chips. If I were to change anything, I’d add some more potato chip swirls. Maybe even keep the potato chip swirls but then include chocolate covered potato chips instead of the chocolate chips? I really hope this isn’t a fleeting “limited botch”"
2_bj,Rayah,2020-04-19,5,For all the people who dip their fries in a frosty,17,7,"Absolutely delicious. Sweet, salty, creamy and crunchy. This is a pint of oxymorons and I love it."

2_bj,lina uwu,2020-08-03,5,This is literally perfect.,2,0,When i saw this i thought it would be gross because chips and ice cream seems just gross together but when my sister convinced me to try it i felt fireworks. the chips are perfectly salty and the chocolate isn't to chocolaty! Its perfect for people who eat dip their french fries in chocolate ice cream and its a fun and unique flavor to try out! would highly recommend!! :D
2_bj,cmitch927,2020-07-23,5,Make Chip Happens Permanent!,1,0,"When I first came upon this early June I tried the pint and within 5 minutes it was gone. The rich, velvety milk chocolate ice cream blends well with the contrasting textures of chocolate chunks and salty potato chips. I find a reason to drive 10 minutes 3 times a week just to stock up on this flavor exclusively. I am willing to lead the charge to make this flavor permanent. It's genius! I was disappointed that imy local store had sold out. I hope you consider this as a Fan Favorite!"
2_bj,DelightandTuchus,2020-07-06,5,My New Number 1,1,5,"In the beginning my favorite was Coffee Toffee Bar crunch. Rich coffee, with satisfyingly semi-salted toffee. Salty-sweet taste combo stage-one unlocked."

Far superior to their earlier 'Netflix and Chilled' option I certainly hope this 'limited botch' ice-cream becomesa mainstay as it is delicious and perhaps the best ice-cream that B&J has in Australia atm!"
2_bj,HBunny,2020-05-07,2,Had such potential,6,3,"I was so excited to find this special pint - unfortunately, mine barely had the potato chip swirl I was looking forward to! Ben and Jerry’s are known for their ample mix ins, and this didn’t make the cut. Really bummed!"
2_bj,Pnw2015,2020-07-25,5,Amazing sweet and salty,2,0,I’m a sucker for chocolate covered potato chips. This ice cream is my major weakness. The chocolate ice cream is the best (and I don’t care for chocolate ice cream). I hope this flavor stays.
2_bj,Kate925,2020-07-31,5,Should be a permanent flavor!,2,0,"You guys nailed this one! It is perfection, the sweetness of the ice cream with a hint of saltiness of chips. I’d buy it every time I went shopping if it was a permanent flavor!"
2_bj,Buffalobabe,2020-06-26,1,Don’t want to ever eat this again,8,6,I’ve had ice cream with chips before and enjoyed it so was excited for this one. But this flavor is truly terrible. My boyfriend and i each ate a scoop & decided to throw the rest away - a choice we’ve never made before.
2_bj,Jules0408,2020-06-06,5,Very Good!,9,6,"I bought this in substitute of Americone Dream and I have got to say, I love this ice cream!! It tastes so good!"
2_bj,victorialee,2020-06-06,5,Wonderful creation that makes the day better!,1,6,"I didn't buy it when I first saw this flavor at the store because potato chips aren't the usual ingredient in ice cream. But then I was convinced by my sister to try it, whether I like it or not, at least I will actually know how I feel. And oh boy, was I delighted!!! It's truly beautiful creation..!!! It tasted like eating potato chips and drinking chocolate shake at the same time (it doesn't sound weird anymore.) The potato chip swirls are, in fact, CRUNCHY, and salty! So yummy! I am happy that I decided to give this flavor a chance."
2_bj,Snorkie,2020-09-23,1,Good idea bad in reality,0,0,"Potato chips are dark tasting, like the crunchy burnt ends in kettle chips. First time I’ve gotten a flavor that I just couldn’t finish."
2_bj,Sebs2020,2020-06-11,2,"Too Strange, Two Stars",5,3,"Regular flavor made worse with potato chips. The combination of potato chips with chocolate ice cream is too strange for me. If you can't tell, I don't dip my fries in my milkshakes."
2_bj,Ilikeicecream1002134,2020-07-21,5,Make it permanent please!!!!,2,1,"Perfect chocolate ice cream! I love the lighter, less intense chocolate ice cream that’s similar to one of my other faves (chocolate milk and cookies). It really tastes more like chocolate milk. The potato chip swirls are a perfect salty complement to the mild sweet. Im a huge fan of chocolate covered chips so this is right up my wheel house. PLEASE make this a permanent flavor!!!"
2_bj,Nicki19,2020-08-17,5,Best ice cream!,1,0,After Trader Joe’s discontinued their chocolate covered potato’s chips I’ve been in search for something close. This nailed the same flavor and was so much better. Great mix of sweet and salty. It’s like in n out fries dipped in their chocolate milkshake. Turned my whole family onto this flavor and we bought out the two stores that carried it. Please Please continue the flavor!
2_bj,MamaCat,2020-06-12,1,A grainy aweful mess,8,8,"Ew, not good at all. The chip swirl is like chewing sand and it disrupts the rest of ice cream. This was not pleasant. Icky stuff. Wish I’d never tried it."
2_bj,knscott,2020-07-18,5,Please make this permanent!,1,2,"I’ve never felt moved to write an ice cream review before - a friend recommended this flavor, which has been hard to find so when I came across a pint buried in the freezer at a store I don’t usually go to, I was excited to try it. Honestly this is one of the best combos I’ve ever had and I’m not usually a big fan of chocolate ice cream. The potato chips are insanely good and the mix is perfect for salty/sweet lovers like me. PLEASE consider expanding this beyond a “limited botch”!"
2_bj,Ashp,2020-09-06,5,Make it a KEEPER!!!,0,0,"I remember when A flavor called “Late Night Snack” was released a few years back and it was the first and only ice cream I’d ever tried with potato chips in it. I was put off by the idea of someone ruining ice cream with such an absurd idea but trust me people, potato chips and ice cream belong together!!!! I was bummed when Late Night Snack never appeared again but was ecstatic when this flavor released!!! Please don’t get rid of this flavor!!! My local store cannot keep it stocked because it is THAT good!!!!"
2_bj,Roomba,2020-08-23,1,Nope,5,4,I love Ben&Jerry's but this flavor was a disaster. The chocolate doesn't mix with the saltiness of the chips and it just tastes so wrong.
2_bj,jon1,2020-07-26,5,Please make permanent!,1,0,this is my new favorite flavor. this chocolate base is better than any of their others and this potato chip swirl is incredible. i don't buy ben and jerry's that often because of the price point but i would for this pint! this is an incredible sweet and salty blend and i can't get enugh!
2_bj,JustDesserts,2020-07-19,5,My absolute favorite: please keep permanently!,1,2,Oh my goodness—this combination of salty and sweet is everything I need in life. I could never have another flavor of ice cream in my life and be just fine.
2_bj,Miranclan,2020-06-27,5,Please make it permanent!!!,1,5,"I do not write reviews very often at all, but I really wish this was a permanent flavor and I am hoping if they get enough great reviews it will be. I was skeptical of course that it would just be soggy chips in a pile of icecream, but it is in fact crisp af. It is a must try flavor I wish I could find anywhere, but unfortunately I have to drive to one specific Target to get my hands on it. Thanks to Ben and Jerry's for all of their hands on support in the community."
2_bj,macintosh1597,2020-05-23,5,LITERALLY THE BEST FLAVOR EVER,1,6,"My roommate brought this glorious flavor home for our late night binge and my life will never be the same. I have a huge sweet tooth so I have a lot of experience when it comes to ice cream. This flavor is the perfect mixture of sweet and chocolaty with a sprinkle of salty. It honestly reminds me of dipping a french fry in my Wendy's frosty, dare I say it. I am seriously in love, I can't find it in my local store anymore so really hoping it becomes a permanent flavor."
2_bj,Kate001,2020-07-23,5,Delicious!,1,0,I got this a number of days ago and it’s absolutely delicious. The chip swirl makes sure you get it throughout the ice cream. I really hope this stays in the collection!!

2_bj,BigTom97,2020-07-23,5,My all time time favorite,1,0,This ice cream is my newest addiction. I have been buying as much as I Can before it’s gone. I’m begging for this to become a permanent flavor.

2_bj,Zoe2000,2020-05-06,2,Too Salty,5,6,Wayyyy to salty I couldn’t even finish it. but I did enjoy the chocolate.
2_bj,Bearsie,2020-06-07,3,"Delicious Chocolate, Iffy Chips",0,0,"Love trying new Ben and Jerry’s flavors, so I immediately grabs this when I saw it on the shelf. Overall it takes like dipping fries into a Wendy’s Frosty. The chocolate flavor is AMAZING! However, I wasn’t a big fan of the chip “swirls”. It’s soft and doughy, but salty like a chip. The texture threw me off, and reminded me of salt dough. I wasn’t able to enjoy it. If they made just the chocolate flavor separately I would definitely buy it! Tastes just like a frosty."
2_bj,wdb1974,2020-07-22,5,One of the few good things to happen in 2020,2,1,"What a great combination of flavors, I truly hope this will be around for awhile."
2_bj,lizziea,2020-08-11,5,"If you get rid of this, I will cry.",0,0,"This is the best ice cream flavor ever. I'm someone who gets fries and dips them in a chocolate shake, and this ice cream is like that but with less mess, more texture, and more flavor. I love the sweet and salty combo, and I feel that the addition of the chocolate chunks are really what make this ice cream so unbelievably fantastic. And the chips -- they're in a swirl, they stay crunchy, and there's the perfect amount! The combination of textures and flavors is just amazing.
My only complaint is that this is a limited botch. Like the title of this review says, there will be tears from me if you get rid of this. This NEEDS to be a regular flavor, and I really hope this opens up the door for more sweet and salty flavors. Please don't get rid of this flavor! If you do, I will hoard as many pints as possible and eat them for years."
2_bj,rexicon,2020-07-02,5,if you ever dipped your french fries in a frosty..,1,5,"i’m always a fan of the sweet and salty combination, especially chocolate and salt. i also love chocolate covered potato chips, AND i’m a fan of the show so this was a no brainer. it’s rich, the flavors work really well together and it’s equitably distributed throughout. i can’t express how much i love this flavor, how many pints my partner and i go through, and how much i hope it stays in permanent rotation. NAILED IT!"
2_bj,Faye,2020-07-19,3,Make this flavor permanent!!!!!,2,2,Cherry Garcia used to be my favorite. I cannot get enough of Chip Happens. Please make this flavor a regular and not a limited addition. It will bring happiness across the world.
2_bj,Sheri,2020-06-29,5,Perfect Combo of Sweet & Savory!,3,6,"Best new Ben & Jerry’s flavor since Tonight Dough! I almost ate an entire pint in one sitting, it was so good. It has all my favorite things in one ice cream! I certainly hope that you keep this flavor around, it’s too good to be a limited batch only."
2_bj,marvelouscara,2020-07-06,5,Amazing chocolate CHIPs!,1,5,"I have always been a huge fan of chocolate covered potato chips, so when I saw Ben and Jerry’s had come out with a flavor including both of these flavors, I had to try it. I do not know how they did it, but getting the chips into the ice cream without the chips becoming soggy is a dream come true, and absolute magic as far as I’m concerned. I have found my favorite ever ice cream. Thank you!"
2_bj,BP13,2020-08-20,5,Perfect Mix of Sweet and Salty,0,0,"This flavor is freaking amazing! After falling in love with another limited batch flavor, I told myself I wouldn't try any others in case they disappear forever. Well when I saw Chip Happens at the grocery store I couldn't resist... and have bought a dozen pints since! The chocolate flavor is rich but somehow still light, the chocolate chunks add to the sweetness perfectly, and the chip crumbles are heavenly. 5 stars."
2_bj,Mallory,2020-07-11,5,"I came here to write a review, didnt I?",1,5,"This ice cream is my favorite. It’s salty and sweet at the perfect combination of happiness on a spoon. I want to stockpile it because I can’t imagine a world where I can’t grab this guilty please out of the fridge. It’s getting me through social distancing and COVID19 and the woes of the world. I beseech you, please make this a permanent addition. I’m begging. I’m pleading."

2_bj,JBinMidTN,2020-07-06,5,Please make this a permanent flavor!,2,5,"Real truth, I’ve never been a huge fan of Ben & Jerry’s. Most flavors sound amazing but they end up being a let down. This is an exception. The chocolate base is just right and the potato chip ribbons contrast the sweet with just enough salty. It’s perfection."

Love their ice cream and their values."

2_bj,jamesy,2020-07-18,2,Kinda average,1,2,So I literally just bought it and was excited but I dunno it’s kinda mediocre. Obviously B&J makes fantastic ice cream this one just ain’t doin it for me. The potato chips are chewy not crunchy and they taste kinda fake I found myself eating around the potato bits.
2_bj,RumorHasItGodIsATexan,2020-07-05,5,Should be a permanent flavor,1,5,"I was hesitant to try this, but it was on sale so I figured I’d got it a shot. Omg. I’m not usually a big sweet and salty person because I think it can make the sweet taste too sweet, but this ice cream balanced the flavors perfectly. Also the chips are somehow perfectly crisp and crunchy. Please make this a forever flavor!!"

My ice cream of choice is Chubby Hubby, it’s been that for years but it just got knocked down to second place. This Chip Happens is the best ice cream flavor Ive ever had.

2_bj,NINmuffin,2020-06-15,5,OMG,1,5,This ice cream was so delicious that it made me write a review in the hopes it will not end up in the flavor graveyard like my beloved Vermonty python.

2_bj,audrey the icecream lover,2020-08-24,5,MY FAVORITEST ICE CREAM EVAARRRRRRRR,0,0,"Dearest Ben and Jerry,
Chip Happens is the most divine ice cream flavor to ever grace this earth. Honestly, the way the potato chips looked on the packaging looked a little suspicious. BUT, I was BLOWN AWAY WHEN I TASTED THIS MASTERPIECE OF A FROZEN DESSERT. I LOVE IT SO MUCH. it is the PERFECT combination of sweet and salty. And just REALLY GOOD. In fact, I recommended it to a friend, who once said his favorite flavor was mint chip. BUT ONCE HE TASTED HE THE HEAVENLY TASTE OF CHIP HAPPENS, HE WAS converted as well. We ate so much ice cream for two weeks and put hot fudge on it. It was really a beautiful experience. I will forever hold these memories close to my heart. A month later, I returned to the grocery store scouring the shelves for my beloved ice cream. And to my horror, I could not find it. I even had a whole conversation with a lady at the grocery store employee about how distraught i was. I returned home, sad, hungry, and heartbroken, for my beloved ice cream had left. But, I will not rest until i can experience this ice cream flavor once more. I am calling on you Ben and Jerry, BRING BACK THIS ICE CREAM FLAVOR. IT IS SO MUCH BETTER THAN YOUR STANDARD FLAVORS AND DESERVES TO BE RECOGNIZED FOR THE BEAUTEOUS FOOD ITEM IT IS. I WISH FOR NOTHING MORE THAN TO TASTE THE SWEET GOODNESS OF CHIP HAPPENS.
Love,
Audrey"
3_bj,Doglover88888888,2020-08-12,5,OMG!!!!!! SOOOOOOO DELICIOUS!!!!!,12,1,Am trying this flavor for the first time right now. Took my first bite and fell in love IMMEDIATELY!! May just be my new favorite flavor!! Have tried a different brand of mascarpone ice cream before and it basically just tasted like vanilla. This is the complete opposite!! Definitely not just plain old boring vanilla!! Can NOT believe how amazingly delicious this is!! Everyone needs to try this now!! Would probably drive 10 hours to get this if i had to like omg it's just that good!!!!!!!!!! Please ben and jerry's-I'm literally begging you to keep this flavor FOREVER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
3_bj,Plumber,2020-08-18,5,LOVE THE SWIRL,1,1,"I love this flavor. It’s light but packs a POWERFUL flavor punch. And the swirl is kind of hidden by its color but man if you find a big pocket of it and try and isolate it, it’s the BEST. The chocolate covered pastry things have Always been crunchy in my 20+ pints to date. The flavor is just so boom in your face. The texture of the Mars alone swirl is insane. This is my 2nd favorite flavor behind Gimme Smore. So help me god if you guys discontinue this flavor or gimme smore, I will come down on you with the wrath of a thousand lightning bolts. Haha. Plz make a cake batter with chocolate chocolate chip swirl and a brownie batter something"
3_bj,Arubaman68,2020-03-29,5,My Prayers Have Been Answered!!,4,1,"I was devastated when the “Holly Cannoli” flavor was discontinued years ago. Every time I passed the ice cream aisle in my supermarket, I’d search for the Cannoli flavor, hoping to see it again. Just when I was about to give up, THERE IT WAS!!!!! I scooped up every pint I could get my hands on. This flavor is the best!! The sweet marscapone cream and chocolatey shell pieces make for a sweet celebration for the tastebuds. Thank you so much for bringing this awesome flavor back! Please don’t ever discontinue it again. You’ve struck gold with this flavor — it is truly is a treat!"
3_bj,antaresoceana,2020-06-14,5,I think this is my new 2nd favourite ice cream,6,1,"Oh man. Where to begin. Two bites and I knew. The marscapone ice cream? Dude. The cannoli shells? DUDE. They're so crispy it's almost like magic how crispy they stay. And coated in chocolate nonetheless! The marscapone swirl is something you almost forget about too but like not even in a bad way because you end up stumbling upon it without expecting to do so and it HITS YOU IN THE FACE WITH DECADENT FLAOUR. Also the chocolate chips are the mini's, the cute ones. Perfectly sized!! B & J knocked it out of the park with this one. A+++"
3_bj,Christine94,2020-02-10,5,SO HAPPY IT IS BACK,16,2,Please keep this around forever! For over 7 years I have hoped that this day would come where my favorite dessert ever would return! Such a delicious ice cream!
3_bj,Kalidoscope,2020-04-06,4,Not half bad,1,0,"The icecream itself is luxuriously fatty, so it does take some time to eat this as compared to opposing flavors. The mascarpone swirls is what I'd say takes the cake for me, though be aware that not all the chocolate-covered cannoli pieces will be as crisp as you'd expect them to be."
3_bj,CraigShew,2020-02-17,5,I eat one a day,9,1,"This is so good, i have been eating one a day, please keep this around so i can keep eating it"
3_bj,jndnaps,2020-04-05,1,Absolutely Terrible!,3,7,I love cannoli's and couldn't wait to try this. Finally found it and was so excited. But it was a total let down. This taste nothing like any cannoli I ever had. Absolutely terrible.
3_bj,Soni,2020-02-10,5,Thank you for making my dreams come true!,5,1,"I have been craving, whining about, and reminiscing about this flavor for YEARS."
3_bj,Scabicky,2020-09-23,1,Cannoli? I don’t think so,0,0,"Not only does this ice cream do nothing to remind you of a cannoli it does not taste good at all. The container says A fan favorite.Overly sweet with an unpleasant aftertaste. Took two bites and tossed the rest. A total misfire. Clearly those fans have never tasted a real cannoli or one of B&J’s better flavors,"
3_bj,Danilicious,2020-08-25,5,Holy Cannoli!!!!,0,0,"Bought this on my recent trip to Target. Had NO expectations...it just sounded interesting. To my surprise this flavor has quickly become my new fave! (Right under Half Baked) It seemed creamier than usual which I attribute to the marscapone. The cannoli pieces are delish and it is an overall pleasant experience. No clue why anyone would call it ""plain"" unless they were expecting the ice cream to be the flavor of the shell or something. If you are looking for something packed with flavor this one isn't for you. This flavor is meant to have when youre craving a more sophisticated dessert. Quick tip: let it sit out until its soft enough that you're not waging war between it and your spoon at every bite. Takes it to another level ;)"
3_bj,Fallerina,2020-04-30,2,Where’s the shell pieces?!,1,0,"The flavor is great, but there were almost no pieces of the cannoli shell in the pint. My husband and I both thought it was strange, and maybe a bad batch because you can always count on the pints to be pretty full of all the good stuff listed in the description. But not this time. And I see from another review that maybe this isn’t a fluke after all. The cannoli shell is the best part of the dessert, so it shouldn’t be skimped."
3_bj,ChrisColby,2020-02-26,5,Hopefully never discontinued again!,3,2,"A delicious take on the classic Italian dessert, B&J's Cannoli is a winner. The base is described as a marscapone flavor. Now marscapone isn't typically used for Cannolis but instead ricotta. Marscapone is a cream cheese used for cakes and other desserts. While not quite fitting the theme of a Cannoli in that regard, B&J made the right choice for the sake of flavor. The base is absolutely like a heightened cheesecake. Almost as if their regular cheesecake flavor was mixed with the equally delicious buttery brown sugar one. It's fantastic. The swirl is the same flavor, so they blend together seamlessly for a full on sweet cream cheese taste. And the pastry pieces are the perfect contrast to the base. Crunchy and covered in chocolate, they remind me of the similar chocolate dipped waffle cone pieces from Americone Dream, and there are plenty in each pint. Whether it fits the theme or not, Cannoli is a great flavor that I hope stays as a mainline one for a long time."
3_bj,whatdeanerwastalkingabout,2020-03-24,1,Bland and Disappointing,7,7,"Finally found this and regret it. It doesn’t taste at all like a cannoli, the bits were sparse and again, tasteless, like eating little chucks of chocolate covered cardboard. Waste of money and calories; just eat a cannoli."
3_bj,LacySeesRed,2020-08-21,1,"If you like cannolis, you won't like this",0,0,"Do yourself a favor and put this ice cream down, walk over to the bakery section of whatever store you're in and get an actual cannoli. This tastes like someone added a crap ton of powdered sugar to artificially flavored cheesecake ice cream and blended it with stale cannoli bits (these could also be bran flakes for all I can tell but I'll take their word for it.)
So if you want a cannoli, get a cannoli and if you want Ben and Jerry's get a more reliable and well made flavor, they have so much better to offer than this."
3_bj,RealIceCreamLover,2020-05-07,2,Doesn't taste like a cannoli.,1,0,"First of all traditional cannoli are made with ricotta, not mascarpone. This tastes more like tiramisu without the coffee. It's missing the liquor flavor of a cannoli and was too cheesy. It would be better if it had chocolate shavings, but the base is wrong. I ate it, but I would not it buy again."
3_bj,Bionicbello,2020-09-12,5,Makes my Italian knees shake with pleasure!,1,0,I happened to find this flavor when I went shopping today at Albertsons and I love all kinds of Italian cuisine. Cannolis are one of my favorite desserts. The flavor of this ice cream was delicious and tasted exactly like a cannoli! Perfect flavor!!
3_bj,Jpan99,2020-05-07,1,Not at all like a Cannoli,1,0,"I was so excited to try this because I love a good cannoli. The taste was just wrong. I really didn't like anything about this flavor. The ice cream itself was marscapone which isn't what's in a cannoli. This was just a fail, cannot recommend."
3_bj,givemethecream007,2020-05-05,3,"Good, not impressed",1,0,"The ice cream is light and fluffy, just as expected from Ben & Jerry’s, but I think the mascarpone ice cream is just a variant of vanilla ice cream. The crunch from the chocolate shells is rad and the mascarpone swirls are delicious."
3_bj,Meli24,2020-05-02,4,Could’ve been perfect!,1,0,Bought this a few days ago after searching for a while. So looking forward to it. I loved the flavors BUT it should have had way more cannoli shell pieces. There were barely any at all.
3_bj,gillian_belle,2020-06-10,5,DELICIOUS,1,0,Chunks were found throughout and I really enjoyed ice cream so reminiscent of my fave dessert.

I have literally written the website 100s of times begging them to bring it back!! For years I have regaled my now fiancé with tales of the elusive, delicious limited batch Cannoli ice cream. Well fast forward about a decade and in walks my fiancé carrying not 1, not 2, but 3 pints of the permanent Cannoli pint. It’s just as delicious as I remember."
3_bj,Giavana 12,2020-05-26,1,Horrible,1,2,"I usually love Ben & Jerry but this ice cream was horrible. It tastes nothing like a cannoli. I was so excited to eat this, and looked everywhere for it, and it's a total let down. The ""cannoli shells"" taste like waffle cones, and the mascarpone tastes horrible. This has a after taste and honestly just a total let down."
3_bj,fishylex,2020-06-10,1,"Strange strong flavor, mix ins sparse.",0,0,"I was a big fan of the retired* Holy Cannoli. This version has a strange strong flavor from 1st taste. The mix ins were sparse, which was not right** regardless of whether I liked the flavor or not.
*Original was ricotta and pistachio ice cream with chocolate covered cannoli and roasted pistachios. It bombed and was retired one year later.
**Pint bottom: NOV0921BJ1 5095 22:59 67867261."
3_bj,Jessieleigh,2020-05-24,2,If you like cake frosting...,0,0,"If you like cake frosting... then this is your ice cream. I don’t taste cannoli not even in the least. Just sugar, like cake frosting. I do like the chocolate coated pastry pieces but they were few and far between. I will eat it because i paid a lot of money for it. But pretty disappointed. There isnt any cinnamon flavor or rose water like i put in my homemade cannoli. :-("
3_bj,Doreen,2020-06-13,2,Not as good as the prior Holy Cannoli,0,0,"Holy Cannoli was my second favorite Ben & Jerry's of all time. When I heard it was coming back as Cannoli, I couldn't wait to find it locally. Unfortunately, I was disappointed as it had changed from ""Creamy Ricotta and Pistachio Ice Cream with Chocolate Covered Cannolis and Roasted Pistachios"" and didn't taste as good. Bring back the old Holy Cannoli!"
3_bj,GoBlue99,2020-04-12,2,Nothing like a real cannoli.,0,0,Chocolate chip cannoli is one of my favorite desserts. I grew up in Boston and know great cannoli. So I was very excited to try this flavor.
3_bj,NillaRilla,2020-03-10,3,Meh,1,1,Not my favorite.....Tastes nothing like a Cannoli.
3_bj,Princess Qajar,2020-05-20,2,Well....,0,2,"Your Cannoli ice cream
Which claims to be Sicily’s finest in flavors, is a complete abomination to the Italian community.
If you’re going to label the thick, creamy, tangy Italian cheese TWICE in your label, I should be able to taste it. Or better yet!!- see it in the ingredients list. Please refine this product.
Thank you"
3_bj,Mimi232,2020-07-13,4,Good Not bad,0,0,"So one thing I love about this ice cream is the crunchy waffle cones covered in chocolate it’s very similar to Americone dream but I think I still prefer the American dream better because of the plain vanilla flavor with caramel.
This one I know is supposed to be the mascarpone flavor. It’s not bad but not my favorite."
3_bj,Christi102,2020-03-01,3,Needs more bits!,1,2,"This ice cream is very good, however I think that it would benefit from having more cannoli bits in it. If it’s called cannoli it should have more cannoli in it."
3_bj,Ikay,2020-08-03,5,My favorite,0,0,"I love cannolis and I love this ice cream but I wouldn't say they taste the same. This is really rich. On my first bite I thought it was a bit too strong, but it really grew on me. Love hitting those mascarpone swirls, and the pastry shell pieces are nice and crunchy. Happy it's permanent to the line."
3_bj,billthecat,2020-06-13,1,Would have preferred Holy Cannoli,0,0,I was so excited to see this. I was a little concerned when I saw that it was made with mascarpone ... which has no place in a true Sicilian cannoli. I should have known ... this is only what a grocery store cannoli would possibly taste like. Bring back the REAL cannoli ice cream: Holy Cannoli.
3_bj,catcrazy73,2020-05-02,4,Good stuff!,0,0,"Found Cannoli in my store recently and decided to give it a try, as I'm from a predominantly Italian area and a fan of the real pastry. Tasty ice cream, super creamy and fun. Could use a bit more of the cannoli bits, though, which was the only reason it didn't get 5 stars. Still a top 5!"
3_bj,Jbi22,2020-04-13,2,Underwhelming,0,0,"Not sure how this is a “fan favorite”... the ice cream base is this weird artificial vanilla, the mascarpone swirl is this gritty, undercooked batter and the fudge cone flakes literally feel and taste like cardboard. I WOULDNT recommend this flavor unless you enjoying wasting your money"
3_bj,Norrrrm,2020-07-03,1,First Ben & Jerry's Flavor I did not like,0,0,"I'm a big Cannoli fan. The filling is so important but so his the shell. This just didn't taste like cannoli to me at all. I'm a native New Yorker and perhaps the filling and shells here are not typical of the rest of the country, but both sure are gold standard in my book"
3_bj,JLE90,2020-04-19,5,Love it,0,0,Fantastic. Saw this in the store while working out of town in Jacksonville. Let’s just say the Publix gets bought out every-time I go. Since I can’t find Cinnabon anywhere this one is my new go to. Netflix and chilled is tasty as well classic favorites in one for that one

3_bj,TheMayorReview,2020-08-14,1,Terrible!,0,0,I was so excited to find ice cream that allegedly tasted like cannolis. It tasted like utter disappointment! It tasted absolutely nothing like cannolis!

3_bj,Rozalynne,2020-06-26,1,Did you have anyone who has eaten a cannoli taste,0,1,I bought this tonight and it is straight up vanilla ice cream with chocolate chips. Did there taste testers actually ever have a cannoli? This had no resemblance to the taste of a cannoli. So upset this was a flavor failure
3_bj,Paigem212,2020-07-31,5,New Favorite,0,0,I was really skeptical of the flavor because I’ve never had a cannoli before but I decided to try it because the americone was out at my grocery store and WOW! Genuinely this is my new favorite flavor *chef’s kiss*

3_bj,Bluemeaney,2020-03-29,5,TAKE THE CANNOLI!,0,0,Literally the most scrumptious B&J’s flavor I have ever had. I ate the whole pint *accidentally* in 6 minutes. I have built a shrine to its perfection in my fridge. FREAKING YUMMY!
3_bj,Lacapaneus,2020-03-26,5,Thank you for bringing this back!,0,0,This redux is better than the original cannoli flavor that I tried. The mascarpone made it softer than many other flavors and it wasn’t overly sweet like some flavors.
3_bj,Idontusuallydothis,2020-08-23,5,Best flavor I've had,0,0,I have a sweet tooth but Ice Cream is usually lower on my list of must have treats. This ice cream changed that for me. Love it. Happy it is back for good!!

4_bj,,2018-12-04,5,best flavor hands down,27,0,This is my favorite flavor in the entire world please make it a permanent flavor!! I made all my friends go out and try it and we're all addicted. I have three pints a week. I wish I was joking. We single handedly bought all of the Gimme S'more stock in our grocery store. The day this flavor is retired is the day my happiness dies. :)
4_bj,Chicksluvrock,2018-09-06,5,Smart way to make a Smore's flavor,20,0,"I have several favorite B&J's flavors, but I decided to go outside of my usual and get this flavor. With the first bite you can definitely taste a hint of marshmallow-y flavor in the base ice cream. It's different than just plain vanilla. I think they did a great job capturing that flavor. The chocolate cookie swirl and graham swirl is smart and I think it's a unique way to add the classic flavor of a smore. And of course, you can't go wrong with fudge flakes! I am a total mix-in and swirl junkie, the more the better, and Ben & Jerry's never disappoints with that! Great job on this flavor! Overall a unique take on a novel summer treat!"
4_bj,KGibby,2019-08-21,5,Way better than the OG S'mores!,42,6,"I've had many pints of the Gimme S'more while it's been out and tonight I accidentally grabbed the original S'mores, with the chocolate ice cream. It was the most disappointing moment when I opened the pint to find chocolate ice cream instead of the typical golden ice cream I was used to with the Gimme S'more. Gimme S'more is the perfect representation of what a S'more is: mostly composed of perfectly toasted marshmallows, hint of chocolate, and a great trail of graham crackers. I will be so sad when this pint leaves the shelves. And I will never make the mistake of buying the OG S'mores pint again. Too much chocolate to represent a S'more."
4_bj,HarleyQuinn,2018-04-25,5,My New Favorite,17,3,"I recently had the pleasure of taking a tour of Ben & Jerry's in VT and this was the flavor sample of the day. Instantly, I was hooked. I've been buying some from my local CT grocery store since. There was a sale one night and the store was out. I sat on the floor and cried. While the ice cream base may not taste exactly like marshmallows, is delicious. Everything about this flavor is amazing!"
4_bj,laurenlaughs24,2019-02-14,5,BEST FLAVOR EVER!!!,2,0,"I am so sad that this is a limited batch. Gimme S'more is my all time favorite flavor and I've tried almost all the Ben & Jerry's flavors. It is like heaven in your mouth. The graham cracker swirl and chocolate cookie swirl are my two favorite things about this ice cream. Since the flavor is slowly leaving, my friends and I have gone to multiple stores to stock up on what is left. As you can tell we LOVE Gimme S'more and if you're a s'mores lover like me then it's worth the try!"
4_bj,Phish Food Fan,2018-10-30,5,"Breathe, it’s gonna be ok.",13,1,"This is such a great new pint! I stocked up and my freezer is loaded with them. The ice cream, the swirls and chunks are so so yummy! If I could eat it every night, I would. This is a LIMITED BATCH! It did not replace S’mores. It’s still available in stores and online. Gimme S’more has come and will go again and regular S’mores will remain. The very first S’mores was retired but the one we’ve been enjoying for quite a while now is still there. So enjoy this for what it is and have your regular S’mores too."
4_bj,VJ101,2018-04-03,5,New Favorite Flavor,21,5,"This is so delicious! It tastes like an amped up cookies and cream but with a graham cracker taste. A S'more is like a cookie so I'm not complaining. I also like it better than the Original. This is my new favorite flavor! I don't think the base tastes like regular vanilla at all. It may not be marshmallow-y, but it's definitely a ""warm, dark"" and border-lining a faint molasses flavor versus a sweet, strong vanilla if that makes sense. This is my new addiction. I think newbie Ben and Jerry's consumers will take a liking to this one."
4_bj,tyler321321321,2020-06-09,1,A worse version of the old one,27,56,"I was having trouble finding my favorite flavor of B&J at the store, when I came accross this one that seemed to be an overhauled version of it. I bought it and took it home only to discover that it tastes nothing like smores. The chocolate cookies are good but have a really out of place flavor. They definitely should have had a soft fudge swirl or something instead. The graham crackers are the best part, but there just weren't enough. And the ice cream which says its ""toasted marshmallow"" flavor just tastes like vanilla. Overall very disappointing not just as a replacement for the old smores but for ben and jerry's in general. I really did not like this one."
4_bj,ChrisColby,2018-04-28,4,"Not quite S'mores, but tasty nonetheless.",4,5,"The new S'mores flavor is much better than the standard flavor from the company. Ben and Jerry's wisely made the decision to use a marshmallow base instead of chocolate, so it doesn't overpower the other components. The base tastes more like sweet cream than marshmallow but when combined with the fudge flakes and graham cracker, the result tastes very close to the real deal. My only complaints are that the chocolate cookie crumbs overpower what little graham cracker there is, losing the theme a little. And the fudge flakes are strangely limited. Still, the components all come together to provide a tasty flavor, and I hope this limited edition lasts as long as possible."
4_bj,Gimmemoresmore,2018-06-25,5,Best EVER,11,3,"Honestly, I don't love ice cream. It's my least favorite dessert. But, about once a year I get a craving. I saw the Gimme S'more ice cream in the store and love s'mores so thought I'd give it a shot. Total game changer. This is the best ice cream I've ever had and I've ended up buying it like 7 times. I'm so sad it's limited edition and hope it becomes permanent. It's perfectly simple and complex-I wouldn't change a thing. I'm reviewing in hopes marketing people see its ratings and decide to keep it!!"

4_bj,Bip407,2018-08-21,2,Prefer original S’mores flavor,3,4,"I feel like this is a just a sweet vanilla ice cream with a cookie swirl, like cookies and cream. There was no noticeable marshmallow flavor, and occasionally I could taste the graham cracker. I much prefer the chocolate based s’mores flavor which was rich chocolate, and a creamy marshmallow, with the perfect amount of crumbly graham cracker. Really, what do you remember about s’mores over the campfire? The melted Hershey chocolate and the gooey toasted marshmallow, followed by the crumbly graham cracker. This new flavor really doesn’t have any of that except the memory of the gritty graham cracker, which was really only there to hold onto the chocolate and marshmallow."

And out of 10+ flavors so far, this is one of my favorites! I have tried the phish and loved it! I wondered how it would taste with a little bit of crunch and so I decided to try this and it did not disappoint!!! The fact this is actually a TOASTED MARSHMALLOW flavored ice cream!!! BOMB. and not only does it contain graham crackers but CHOCOLATE COOKIES BITS too. And of course a generous amount of chocolate chunks and the hints of fudge. GENIUS.
They really did it with this ice cream guys. I’m so blessed I got my hands on this."
4_bj,nflamari9488,2018-03-29,5,"All I kept thinking was ""oh man, oh man!""",14,4,"I literally just bought this 20 minutes ago, put a little bit in a bowl, and decided I had to write the review. I agree with one reviewer where they said the marshmallow ice-cream doesn't really taste like marshmallow. However, I feel like that's a really difficult flavor to capture and the overall execution was very good. I totally tasted the graham cracker pieces and I LOVE the chocolate cookies BJ puts in their ice-cream. If I had to make a critique or suggestion, I would say maybe have more graham cracker swirls and/or flavor the ice-cream graham cracker and have marshmallow swirls with the cookie and graham crackers? I don't know though because I'm pretty overkill with my ice-cream. If it doesn't sound like I'm going to die it wouldn't be my first choice. All in all, I am so happy, I'm struggling to not get more, and I would be very sad if this never came back."

I noticed one love came back again this year so ive been waiting to see this one too especially since I can't imagine a single person who tried this didn't love it. I saw one person in their review said they ate 3 pints a week. I ate a whole pint every single day the whole time it was available. Bought my grocery store out every time they restocked. I still have 3 or 4 a week but no other flavor compares to this one, not even my old favorite. This ice cream ruins all other ice creams."
4_bj,Jenn01234,2020-02-26,1,I have never been let down more,3,0,"The original s'mores ice cream was a dream come true, it was by far my favorite Ben & Jerry's flavor and I even drove to Vermont to tour the facility and get a cone there. When I tried this replacement I had hope to be wowed but was left feeling nothing but disappointment. S'mores do not have cookies in them so I am not sure where that idea came from, and normally I would like cookies in my ice cream but if I am looking for the flavor profile of a s'more this ice cream just doesn't deliver."
4_bj,Bkeller08,2018-04-15,1,Why change a good thing?,10,9,"My favorite flavor of Ben and Jerry’s is S’mores, which I have been a fan of since it was called Marsha Marsha Marshmallow but it is the HARDEST flavor to find! I saw Gimme S’more in my grocery and got so excited! But when I got home, I was disappointed. I thought my favorite part of S’mores was the graham cracker swirls which are also in this flavor, but it turns out, the Chocolate ice cream was more vital to the awesomeness of the flavor than I thought. The “toasted marshmallow” Ice cream just tastes like vanilla. While the add-ins are good, the ice cream part of this pint leaves something to be desired. I guess I’ll forever be on the hunt for my fave flavor “S’mores” because you can’t beat it! They shouldn’t have changed a good thing!"
4_bj,Savv,2019-07-24,5,PLEASE BRING IT BACK,0,0,"I need this flavor to return. This was my favorite flavor of ice cream ever and I would buy multiple pints of it out of fear that I would go to the store one day and the “limited batch” ice cream would be gone. My heart broke as I checked the Ben and Jerry’s section of the freezer and saw that there was no more and it wasn’t coming back. PLEASE bring this back even for just a month so I can buy every stores stock. I’m serious, every time I eat ice cream now I just feel like it isn’t the same as gimme s’mores. I still check the ice cream section at every store I go to and I will continue to do so till it comes back :("
4_bj,Cait5,2018-11-11,2,"Ok, but NOWHERE near as good as the original.",1,5,"Don't get me wrong, it isn't bad. It's fine. But I'm docking it one star because it comes nowhere close to the original S'mores flavor--this strikes me as a disappointing remix. The ice cream itself tastes closer to sweet cream than toasted marshmallow, and it lacks enough chocolate to actually compare it to a s'more--chocolate is supposed to be a constant component of the dessert! While I prefer the original's chocolate base regardless; if this flavor had more chocolate chunks and a toasted marshmallow swirl like the original, it might be a lot better. But as it stands, OG S'mores is still my favorite ice cream flavor ever and this simply doesn't come anywhere close to it."
4_bj,Sarahjo723,2020-07-14,4,So glad they went back to the original recipe,0,0,"I loved the 2014 version of Gimie S‘ more. I was so disappointment when the ice cream flavor was changed to chocolate. That being said, once they brought back the toasted marshmallow flavored ice cream, I was thrilled. I liked the chocolate cookies, but the ice cream felt more like cookies and cream than s’mores, so I just added my own crushed graham crackers. EVEN MORE RECENTLY I noticed they changed the recipe, again. This time it was perfected!! I no longer have to add my own graham crackers."
4_bj,Lare Bear,2019-06-12,3,A solid pint. Great use of flavor choice.,0,0,I bought this flavor last week while making a trip to my local scoop shop. Let me just start out by saying that smores is a hard flavor to really nail flavor wise. I really enjoyed the marshmallow ice cream. Alot of companies usually go with chocolate as a base for Smores and I think that its usually overwhelming and distracting from the marshmallow. So the star of the flavor show was definitely on point. The grahms are great and are a great topping used in alot of flavors lately. Unfortunately tgis pint suffers from the same thing most smores flavored things do and it was ultimately too sweet in my opinion. I enjoyed this pint but theres too many more to try to stop here!
4_bj,Cassidy,2018-04-13,1,Definitely missed the mark,12,7,"S’mores is my favorite flavor EVER. So when I saw Gimme S’mores in my local grocery store I almost fell over I was so excited! However the excitement was short-lived because this is not s’mores. Not even the slightest bit. If I were blindfolded and tried this, I would never guess that it is s’mores flavor. The “marshmallow” ice cream is vanilla and there is no hint of graham cracker. The most overpowering part is the chocolate cookie swirl...which is not s’mores. Don’t get me wrong, the ice cream is good! If I were rating based on taste it would get 5 Stars. But I’m rating it based on how closely it captures the s’mores flavor. If I could give it a 0 I would because this is basically The Tonight Dough without the cookie dough and chocolate ice cream. So do yourself a favor and just get that because at least you have cookie dough."
4_bj,Ateag,2019-04-09,5,The Best and Most Missed,1,0,"This was the best s'more flavored edible substance I have ever consumed. Every time I saw ""Limited Batch"" on the label, I dreaded the day that would be my last time seeing it on the shelves. Mercy shone upon me each time, though, as upon return to my home, all the dread melted away as I rejoiced and beheld Heaven's essence grace my mouth with the textured, creamy delight of Gimme S'more. Alas, the day finally encroached upon my innocent self that I would see in its stead, ""One Love"". I've since settled for Milk&Cookies which I know can never fill the void once occupied by the dessert of unmatched divinity. I dream that one day I'll once again taste the treasure graciously gifted to this unworthy world by the great Ben and Jerry."

Being summer and seeing the store did not have any of my favorites, I thought I would try this ""new"" flavor. I have to say, it is not at all what I was hoping for. I am a marshmallow junkie and was hoping for toasted marshmallow flavor; instead, I felt like I was eating vanilla chocolate chip with some of those cake crunchies that you find in ice cream cakes. I will go back to my regular flavors or skip buying if Gimme S'more is my only other option."
4_bj,ash84,2018-10-07,5,The real deal!,1,0,"I have been a hard-core regular cookie dough ice cream only fan for YEARS, but this flavor caught my eye at the beginning of summer and I haven't been able to buy any other ice cream since! It's the amazing cookie swirl that almost convinced me that I could love the Tonight Dough flavor, despite my hatred for the nasty peanut butter dough. And the ever so creamy toasted marshmellow ice cream was a pleasant surprise! Even the graham cracker swirl blends in perfectly so you don't feel like you have random dry crumbs messing up the texture! It's the perfect combination that at times tastes like what an Oreo ice cream should taste like! I haven't had my go-to cookie dough ice cream in over 4 months and will be incredibly sad when this masterpiece goes away!"
4_bj,moorejennie78,2018-07-15,1,The original S'mores is better,8,3,"This flavor does not remind me of S'mores at all. Why cookies? The chocolate flakes are more like big pieces... too big for this. I couldn't even finish the container. It wasn't worth it. first time I've done that with Ben & Jerry's. Hopefully you'll never quit making the original S'mores, even if they are only in the shops."

I was excited to try this flavor because the other s’mores flavor has chocolate has the ice cream which I personally don’t like, so I was very happy to see this one with a marshmallow ice cream! I will say, marshmallow is a hard flavor
to replicate, so the ice cream tasted more like vanilla to me. This flavor would have benefited from marshmellow bits mixed in. The chocolate cookie swirl and graham cracker swirl were amazing and crunchy! These swirls delivered on the s’mores flavor for me!"
4_bj,Natf,2018-03-28,3,Not what I was expecting.,5,1,"I love s’mores, and don’t get me wrong this flavor is great, but not what I wanted. I was expecting more of a s’mores flavor, and I would explain this ice cream as more of a “marshmallow cookie crunch.” It’s still good! Just not s’mores. It would be better with gooey marshmallows :)"
4_bj,OTstudent90,2018-04-09,1,A miss unfortunately,7,4,"I just bought this as well as my staple, cookie dough. Cookie dough was as usual amazing but this one was just a miss for me. It reminded me of the pint slices, not nearly enough toppings or pieces. It was mostly vanilla ice cream with some cookie pieces in it. Definitely not enough marshmallows to make it feel like a s'mores ice cream. Anyway, I love most of B&Js flavors but this one wasn't for me"
4_bj,Frog,2018-05-31,5,Breaks my Heart this is Only Limited Batch,3,1,"I like ice cream and I eat a fair amount of it but never have I had an ice cream that haunts my dreams like this one. This ice cream might actually be perfect. The toasted marshmallow base is excellent and not too sweet and the flakes of chocolate add the perfect crunch to the blend. I'm not a big chocolate ice cream fan and I think that making the base marshmallow allows all of the flavors to be appreciated as one instead of being overpowered by chocolate. However, by far my favorite part of this ice cream is the graham cracker fudge swirl. Holy moley! It has a fantastic texture and the taste leads me on a whirlwind adventure. I don't know what I have to do to make this more than just a limited batch but I will do it. Every time I go to the grocery store I hold my breath that it will still be there waiting for me, cool and delicious."
4_bj,Givemesmoreforever,2018-04-24,5,Tastes so good it should be illegal,4,3,"This is my new favorite ice cream. While I agree that the base ice cream is not an exact replica of marshmallows, it does not taste like plain vanilla... more like the melted gooey inside of a marshmallow that’s not actually warm or gooey. The add ins are perfection to me between the swirls graham and chocolate cookie I’m in ice cream heaven. I have to carefully calculate my purchases so this is the only cheat on my diet each week! I hope it goes from “limited batch” to “here to stay”!"

I was skeptical to try to the flavor because of the reviews that were already posted but it was amazing. I loved the graham cracker bits. people complain it's not like the regular smores flavor, uh hello duh the smores flavor already exists and is still in stores. This a tasty spin-off and does not disappoint"
4_bj,Westanhalsey,2018-10-15,5,Favorite Flavor!,2,1,I have been buying this consistently for about 5 weeks almost like twice a week because I cannot get enough of this flavor. It’s honestly unhealthy for me at this point and for my bank account because I barely bought ice cream before taking a chance on this one. Delicious! The cookies and graham crackers are amazing in it. I literally went through the process of giving my info just so I could write this review in hopes that the flavor is continued and more people improve upon their lives by buying this flavor.

I’ve gone through 6 pints within a week (multiple times), trying to savor the limited batch that was created (also in hopes of raising the number of pints sold, encouraging your company to keep them on the grocery shelves). There was never a time I’d leave the grocery without one of these pints. Until, my local grocery store finally ran out."

The ice cream itself is not good and the chocolate cookies do not taste like s'mores to me. Please bring the old one back!!!"
4_bj,KerryB88,2018-04-10,2,Overall NOT S'mores!,5,3,It's vanilla ice cream not toasted marshmallow. That alone was extremely disappointing. A little graham cracker swirl was ok. Just didn't go with the ice cream. I did like the chocolate cookie swirl. It basically was a cookies and cream ice cream taste. Only a little bit of fudge flakes but that's fine with me. Extremely disappointed. I love marshmallow.

There needs to be a smoky element, whether that be smoked salt or bits of charred marshmallow. Also there needs to be a LOT more graham. I couldn't taste it at all. This ice cream has the potential to be amazing & legendary. It's tough to re-create the taste of a real s'more though. Hope you keep trying."

I eat my Ben and Jerry’s with one of my son’s toddler spoons to help make the pint last longer (as I always eat the whole thing) but this one I couldn’t help but take huge bites anyway.

I had never tried the original ""S'mores"" flavor, but tried it after loving ""Gimme S'more"".. Gimme S'more is hands down the reigning champ, i feel the other s'mores tastes mostly like a rich chocolate, nowhere near as complex in flavor"

4_bj,Szigler,2018-05-20,2,Not smores,1,0,There are no graham crackers or marshmallow swirls. Doesn't even taste like smores. Chocolate chunks are the best part.
4_bj,Escole3,2020-07-30,5,Cookie swirls are AMAZING,1,0,The chocolate cookie swirls in this blew my mind. Combined with the graham cracker and marshmallow WOW so good.
4_bj,JustBeingHonest,2018-08-25,1,The Greatest Disappointment of 2018,1,2,"I brought this flavor from my local grocery store yesterday because I've been asking for S'more ice cream with toasted marshmallows forever; the wait was finally over or so I thought. Unfortunately, this is NOT S'more flavored ice cream this is however cookies in cream. The ""toasted marshmallows"" taste exactly like the cream filling in Oreos and the double chocolate cookies like the Oreo cookie – Infinite sadness."

4_bj,woodhouse,2018-10-15,5,PLEASE MAKE THIS FLAVOR PERMANENT,0,0,"LOOK. I am a busy person. We all are. And part of what makes being a busy person so bearable is ice cream. Especially Ben and Jerry's ice cream. ESPECIALLY THIS FLAVOR. When I tell you that this is like a sweet and creamy version of every campfire memory of your youth, I mean it. It is every good part about every good flavor that makes S'mores a gosh-darn ethereal pleasure right here on earth. So get in your car, walk to your subway station, or hail the nearest rideshare or omnibus and GET SOME OF THIS BEFORE THEY TAKE IT AWAY."

4_bj,Amercole,2018-09-19,5,The BEST,0,0,"I’m going to be super disappointed when this flavor is gone. I love that there is ZERO chocolate ice cream, but instead wonderful graham crackers and chocolate pieces. The toasted marshmallow ice cream is perfect. This is literally the first time in 30 years I’ve been willing to spend money on Ben and Jerry’s (I don’t exactly see eye to eye with some of their views on certain policies and laws), but as long as they keep selling this, I will keep spending my money!"

Please keep it around!!!"
4_bj,upset,2018-06-21,1,Not feeling' it,2,2,"It didn't really taste like anything, just tasted like vanilla ice cream with specks of cookie and chocolate. And when I say specks, I truly mean specks. Trace evidence of flavor. Not a fan at all, tasted nothing like S'mores."
4_bj,Clhatbix,2018-04-03,3,Not very S'mores like,2,2,It's a good flavor...... but doesn't remind me of s'mores at all. It's more like cookies and cream with graham crackers. It should have the same marshmallow creme that Fish Food has and way more chocolate chunks.
4_bj,mchardy,2018-04-29,4,Give it a good ol' try,1,2,"Upon first spoon, I was overwhelmed with the disappointment of too much chocolate. I assumed that it was just another foolhardy excuse of a s'mores flavored food that would be overpowered with chocolate. However, I persevered and did not give up. As I continued on in my journey, I was greatly impressed. The marshmallow portions in the ice cream were great. was it as up to par as my usual go to staple of the Tonight Dough? No, But it was good enough to wear I would purchase again if I needed something different in my life. It does get better. Do not give up on this flavor, you really just gotta commit. Not a total fail of the s'mores flavor, which tends to be a difficult one to portray, however not a total success. It is good, though maybe not a typical s'mores. I do not think it completely captures the essence of s'mores, however I think that it is decadent and delicious enough for me to purchase again."
4_bj,sweetmel,2018-10-08,1,Not the best,2,2,"Please do not replace the previous s'mores flavor with this one. It hardly has any s'mores flavor at all. All I taste is marshmellow, where's the graham crackers? Nope, I do not want s'more of this one!"
4_bj,Lewsfancy,2018-05-27,1,What a let down!,2,3,"Ok, ok granted I love the original S’mores. I’m just tired of having to drive 37 miles (yes 37!) to get it. This flavor hurt my soul. The base didn’t have any flavor but sweet, the chocolate cookies part was ok. That honestly all the flavors I found. I’ll keep driving the 37 miles."
4_bj,ilovesmores,2018-04-25,5,I need S’more,0,3,"Perfect name, because I can’t stop eating this and I need some more! Oh my gosh, this ice cream is SO good! It’s my favorite ice cream that I’ve bought in a grocery store, and my favorite Ben & Jerry’s flavor since Fossil Fuel. I’m a lover of all things smores, and this is the best smores flavored ice cream I’ve had. I’m going to cry when it’s not in stores anymore. PLEASE make this a permanent flavor, it is too good to just be limited batch!!!"
4_bj,givejackiesmore,2020-06-07,5,New favorite flavor!,0,0,"I was very disappointed when I saw my boyfriend decided to buy this flavor instead of Milk & Cookies... to the point where I ate all the ice cream in my freezer before even thinking about opening this new pint. And boy oh boy was I so wrong - the combinations of flavors in this pint exceeded all expectations and Gimme S'more has now risen the ranks to my new favorite Ben & Jerry's flavor. Don't get me wrong, I will eat ANY flavor, but now when I go to stores, I specifically search for this one! The only thing that makes me sad is that most places don't carry this flavor as it must not be as popular, but when it's available, it's embarrassing how excited I get. Don't sleep on this flavor like I did... I've never written a review for any product I've ever bought in my 27 years of life, and am happy that this is my first. I'd give it 10 stars if I could!"
4_bj,AmyDee,2018-05-31,5,Please keep this flavor!!,1,2,"I tried this for the first time about 3 weeks ago, and have bought an embarrassingly excessive amount since. It is so good. I love how the chocolate isn’t large chunks, and swirls with the graham cracker perfectly. Too often I find a flavor I like only to have it discontinued. Please don’t do that with Gimme S'more!! Keep it!! I promise I’ll keep eating it!!!"

I was searching for my long lost, always hard to find, favorite flavor that I recall having a chocolate base with graham cracker and marshmallow swirls. What happened to that glorious ice cream?! I was ready to love this new version but it wasn't meant to be. If you try again, Ben & Jerry, I will too."

4_bj,Mfennec,2018-11-15,5,Perfect,0,0,"I bought this last week on a whim and was blown away completely. I went on a quest for it today. No one had it, so I decided to try the original S’mores. You guys. This flavor is so much better than the original. The lighter base really helps the contrast of the flavors, and it’s honestly amazing. Completely worth the calories where the original isn’t. I hope I can find it again before it gets discontinued."
4_bj,mfro,2018-08-15,5,Best Flavor Combination Since Half-Baked!,0,0,"I had the pleasure of trying this flavor at the end of the tour, and it's the most excited I'd been about an ice cream flavor in fifteen years. The ice cream itself is phenomenal, as are the chocolate chips, but the FUDGE FLAKES are the winner in my book. Purchased two pints from my local supermarket (four states away) and it's just as delicious. Please, please, please, please, please keep this flavor!!"
4_bj,Smoreslvr,2018-04-03,4,Great flavor but S’mores it is not,0,1,"I was so excited to see this new flavor as I love all things s’mores. I agree with previous reviewers that it reminds me of cookies and cream. A very rich, cookies and cream. What it needs more of is graham and marshmallow, less of the cookie swirl. Having said that, I wouldn’t not buy it if I were in the mood for a little ice cream. Thanks B&J for introducing this new flavor. I hope you keep it around."
4_bj,,2020-05-20,5,BEST EVER,0,0,"I was in Denver, Colorado at a scoop shop and saw the flavor ""Gimme Smore"" I read the description and it sounded good. My friends and family loved it too, and as soon as we got back home we checked if our local grocery store had it and they did! We honestly probably bought 10 of them. Once it left the stores we were devastated and emailed to make sure it would come back and happily it did!!"

Then I found this one! WOW its so good. Please leave it as a consistent flavor!
I have found I can only find it at Kroger sometimes. Publix does not seem to carry ANY new/ limited edition flavors."
4_bj,B28078,2020-05-16,3,Meh,1,1,"Honestly very underwhelming. Maybe if there were more swirls of cookie and graham cracker, or adding marshmallow swirls would help. But I definitely won’t be buying again."

4_bj,Talentchic,2018-04-10,5,Love it beyond,1,1,This is my new favorite flavor. Tonight dough is a very close second. Hope this becomes more than a limited edition. Would be a staple in our freezer
4_bj,Cab44,2018-04-13,5,So Good!,1,1,I ended up trying this flavor because they were out of my favorite. It was so much better than I expected it to be! It might be my new favorite.
4_bj,Kjbedell,2018-04-03,5,So good! My new favorite ice cream,1,1,This is by FAR my new favorite flavor! The crunch from the cookies and graham cracker really makes it! I hope they decide to keep it around
4_bj,Jaaay7282,2018-07-10,1,Disappointed,1,2,It’s currently 1 am and I’m eating my ice cream that I have been looking forward too all day. It’s basically vanilla ice cream with cookies & grahm crackers. The ice cream does not taste like marshmallows & that’s so disappointing.
4_bj,Monday16,2019-04-28,5,Great While it Lasted,0,0,"This was our favorite B&J’s flavor ever. It really tasted just like you were eating a S’mores from a campfire. It was a limited batch and it must be over because it is no longer available where we live. We tried the other B&J’s S’mores Ice Cream, while it is a good chocolate ice cream, it does not really taste like S’mores. Very disappointed it is gone."
4_bj,Laura24,2018-06-02,5,"Not S’mores, But Still Delicious",0,1,"This has all the elements of a s’more, but I don’t get that full s’more flavor when I eat it (I think because the marshmallow flavor isn’t very strong). That being said, it’s absolutely delicious. I love the different textures of the chocolate and graham cracker, and I had to stop myself from going back for more. I will definitely be buying this again!"
4_bj,Max18,2020-06-11,1,Very Disappointing!!,0,0,"I bought this for the 1st time when I couldn't find my favorite ""S'mores"" at the store. Very disappointing!! Tastes nothing like a s'more.

With it's toasted marshmallow, graham crackers and dark chocolate ice cream, it was delicious!!!"

4_bj,kris403,2018-04-27,5,Great taste!,1,2,"For days, I have been stocking up on this flavor. The graham cracker and cookie swirls are the pints' best features!! I would love to see this become a permanent flavor!"

4_bj,BringBackGimmeSmores,2018-10-08,5,This is the best they've ever made.,0,0,"I was on a strict diet and hadn't touched B&J for months. Saw this in the grocery store and didn't even hesitate to take two pints. I love s'mores and I hate chocolate ice cream. It turned out to be even better than my other favorite (Milk and Cookies, which is btw a fight to find in any store because it's bought out so quick).
This ice cream is so good (and also a limited batch) that I drove to every grocery store in the area and bought all of the pints available (about 10 pints were left) because they were ALL on closeout and they were going so fast that I didn't want to risk taking the time to go and get a basket when I found more that 2 in a freezer and just bare-armed carried all of them to the register before someone else could. This is not an insane, ice-cream obsessed town, its a normal town. These are normal people. This ice cream is RIDICULOUS its TOO GOOD. If they don't bring this back as a regularly stocked product I will consider it one of the greatest food related tragedies of my life."
4_bj,Calvin B,2018-04-20,5,Wow.,1,2,Just when I thought Oat of this Swirrled was the best thing EVER. You guys made this flavor.

I accidentally got the smores flavor thinking it was the same and boy was I wrong. The smores one is just plain chocolate whereas this one tastes like a delicious smore.

4_bj,lulu27,2018-07-15,5,BEST FLAVOR EVER,0,0,Honestly I don't know how this flavor only has four stars because it is legitimately one of the best (if not the best) Ben and Jerry's flavors of all time. SOOOO good.
4_bj,BlackThoughtz,2019-01-12,4,Great Flavor,0,0,Wonderful remic to the prior version. I really love the chocolate cookie swirl in this. I really wish there was a pronounced graham cracker in here. Maybe replacing the dark chocolate chip with a cluster of graham cracker instead would probably make this a better flavor IMO
4_bj,Andrea R,2019-01-08,5,EVERYTHING I'VE EVER WANTED,0,0,"Gimme S'more! is one of the best flavors Ben & Jerry's make.
The Marsh mellow is sweet without being too sweet. Great ratio between Chocolate Swirls & Flakes and Graham Cracker Swirl. Although I wish there was MORE Graham Cracker Swirl because it's so tasty and crunchy."
4_bj,TiNiLo,2018-04-29,5,So Good,0,1,I picked this up yesterday and I wasn't sure that I would like it because I tend to be pretty simple in my ice cream tastes.

4_bj,Mkayyy,2018-08-26,5,All time favorite icecream,0,0,I have an obsession. I live around the Algonac mi area. And I guarantee your sells for the gimme s’mores are up thanks to I. I can’t help but eat it on the daily. Absolute best icecream I’ve ever had. I hope it becomes permanent. I’ll be sad to see it go.
4_bj,BenJerrysLover,2019-01-29,5,LOVE IT!!!,0,0,"I love Ben & Jerry's and I have tried many different flavors. However, this one is definitely my favorite! I've lost count of how many pints I have bought so far. I hope you guys decide to keep this flavor, I was disappointed that it said ""Limited Batch""."
4_bj,Zack,2018-10-09,5,Best flavor ever!,0,0,"Please keep this flavor forever, this might be my new all time favorite. Perfect for s'mores lovers, blows the other s'mores flavor out of the water. Love the graham cracker/cookie trails and the toasted marshmallow flavor. It's simply the perfect pint."
4_bj,DanyT,2019-06-26,5,The most delicious flavor ever probably,0,0,Do yourself a favor and try it! Its delicious. The roasted marshmallow ice cream with graham cracker swirls is just a great mix with the chocolate cookie. I made the mistake of confusing is Gimme S'more! for S'more and while it's good it's not as good.
4_bj,Vballmom,2018-08-30,5,BEST ICE CREAM EVER!!,0,0,This is my favorite ice cream by far from anything in store or even fresh from our local ice cream shops! I can’t live without it! I even like it better than the regular s’mores flavor by Ben and Jerry’s. Please please make this a permanent flavor!!!!
4_bj,jdublovesicecream,2019-01-28,5,Absolute Favorite!,0,0,"This is hands-down the best flavor Ben and Jerry’s has ever made! I love all ice cream but this was so delicious. Tons of graham cracker, chocolate chunks, and chocolate swirl throughout. I wish this was made all year long! I highly recommend this."
4_bj,Devo,2018-09-19,5,Best Ben and Jerry’s flavor,0,0,"My husband and I have purchased this flavor multiple times this summer. By far, one of the best flavors and would love it if it became a permanent option. The combination of ingredients is phenomenal, you won’t regret choosing this flavored pint."
4_bj,Anonymous12,2018-12-10,5,This is my favorite flavor,0,1,"Please add this add as permanent flavor!!! Tried this on a whim and its taken over as the only flavor I have in my freezer. I usually have great self control and eat only a little at time, but with this flavor I can't help but eat the whole pint."
4_bj,Holli123,2018-10-28,5,BEST FLAVOR EVER,0,0,Bought this a month ago & went back for it & have not been able to find it since & am DEVASTATED! It is the BEST icecream I've EVER had & I am pretty picky...like about everything. It has a well balanced flavor that tastes LITERALLY like smores
4_bj,Amanda M,2018-09-14,5,PLEASE MAKE PERMANENT!!!!!,0,0,This is literally THE best ice cream I have EVER tasted. I would love nothing more than for it to be permanent. I have bought every single pint at the three grocery stores in my town! I could not have asked for a more perfect flavor combo.
4_bj,Evhybrid,2018-08-07,5,Surprising combo,0,0,"The Gram cracker and chocolate cookie swirls go amazing with the toasted marshmallow ice cream. The fudge flakes add a nice crunch to the texture. Amazing combo of light and rich flavors, def my new favorite. A bit hard to find in stores."
4_bj,Tb12014,2019-06-04,5,Best of the best!,0,0,This is easily the best flavor Ben and Jerry’s has ever released. I firmly believe it should replace the original s’mores because gimme s’mores blows it out of the water. It seems like it’s gone but I’m always on the hunt for it nonetheless
4_bj,StormyDawn,2018-04-12,5,One of the best!,0,1,I bought this one after the store was out of my usual and I give it 10 stars it was perfect! I usual have to pick a flavor that doesn’t have too much hard crunch because of sensitive teeth and this hit the nail on the head! Will buy again!
4_bj,Ali_500,2019-05-20,5,BEST FLAVOR EVER!!,0,0,"This flavor should become a permanent flavor. Way better then the OG S'mores. I was so sad when my grocery store ran out of this Gimme S'more. Please mamke more of this delicious flavor and make it a permanent one, available all the time!!"
4_bj,sydthereader,2020-09-14,4,Almost perfect!,0,0,i tried it today and it was SO good!! the only thing that would make it better is if the ice cream itself had more of a toasted marshmallow taste. i think right now it just tastes like vanilla (maybe just a tiny bit sweeter tho).
4_bj,Saralaw,2018-11-14,5,My absolute favorite flavor!!,0,0,"This is the best flavor, I’m obsessed with it. I have to have at least two pints in my freezer at all times! I know it’s limited edition, but PLEASE keep it!! It’s even topping half baked and mint chocolate cookie as my favorite!"
4_bj,Vinlands Wolf,2018-10-04,4,"Great taste, but not a staple favorite",0,0,"I absolutely love this flavor, all of the flavors stand out on their own but blend well together. I definitely would grab this on occasion when available. But due to lack of availability it just hasn't become a staple favorite."
4_bj,abbey30,2018-04-28,5,New Favorite Flavor!!!,0,1,This is by far the best Smore's flavored ice cream. Do yourself a favor and try this out because you will NOT be disappointed!
4_bj,Nicole145,2019-08-12,5,Waiting for the return,0,0,This is a limited edition batch - but it shouldn't be. It's been months since I last found this in stores and I'm waiting for it's return. PLEASE MAKE THIS A PERMANENT FLAVOR. This is some much better than the OG Smore flavor.
4_bj,JJay15,2020-03-27,5,Favorite Flavor!,0,0,"Hey guys!
This is my absolute favorite flavor and I am so thankful it is back! I don't eat chocolate ice cream so this version of S'mores is perfect with a marshmallow based ice cream instead of the chocolate based ice cream!"
4_bj,BigSmileBear,2019-01-23,5,The BEST!,0,0,The best Ben & Jerry's flavor yet. AWESOME! Hope this one becomes a regular flavor. I ended up buying the four pints that my local grocery store had left and placed in my deep freeze. So much better than the S'more flavor.
4_bj,Chris B,2019-01-08,5,My new favorite!,0,0,Tried this when it first came out and I was hooked. It has become my new favorite and I like it a lot better than the original S’mores. Hopefully they make this a regular flavor as I’m sad it’s becoming harder to find.
4_bj,iheartgimmesmores,2018-09-15,5,AMAZING FLAVOR,0,0,This is probably the best Ben & Jerry's ice cream I've ever had. My boyfriend and I are obsessed with it. We want it to be a permanent flavor not just limited batch!!! It it so so yummy- please keep it forever B&J!!!!
4_bj,Natty825,2020-04-23,5,Best flavor yet,0,0,S'mores is one of my favorite flavors ever and B&J's absolutely killed it. You taste the cookies more than anything but once you get to the marshmallow and graham cracker tastes it is amazing. Would highly recommend.
4_bj,ShennaPunk,2020-08-11,5,This sold me on Marshmallow,0,0,I have never been a fan of marshmallow anything. The exception...Smores over the campfire. This ice cream flavor has me hooked. The marshmallow is subtle but pairs well with the graham cracker and chunky fudgy bits.
4_bj,sunKerst,2018-04-01,5,Almost Perfect!,0,2,I LOVE S'more flavored things and all existing ice creams on the market do not have a good take on it. Ben and Jerry's S'more ice cream is so addicting! Add a bit more graham cracker and perfection will be reached!
4_bj,Clark,2018-08-08,5,Soooo good,0,0,"Every part of this flavor is amazing. The toasted marshmallow ice cream would be good enough on its own, but throw in the graham cracker swirls and chocolate and it's one of the best desserts you can buy frozen"
4_bj,Lasquiz,2020-05-29,5,Suprise!,0,5,"This flavor was surprisingly DELICIOUS!!!! I was hesitant that the marshmallow would be too sweet but it was such a nice flavor, actually more like a cheesecake taste. Definitely will be getting this again!"
4_bj,KassieHaHa,2018-05-21,5,So unique!,0,1,"The marshmallow flavor was very unique! For a s’mores ice cream, I was surprised but happily! I’m usually a chocolate therapy girl, but this may be a new fave! There were plenty of toppings in every bite!"
4_bj,Gimmesmores18,2018-12-08,5,100% New Favorite Flavor - PLEASE KEEP IT!,0,0,"Its like comfort in a pint. Always been a hug fan of Phish Food, but this one is nostalgic and DELICIOUS. I know it’s a limted batch, but I would LOVE to see this on the permanent Ben & Jerry’s lineup!"
4_bj,AliMo,2018-09-30,5,ARE U KIDDING ME,0,0,"Guys, I have eaten a ton of Ben and Jerry in my lifetime but THIS is the best I have ever had. Let’s stop the games and make it a permanent flavor. Once this limited batch is done, I’ll be heartbroken."
4_bj,lmccran,2019-01-13,5,Favorite Ice Cream Ever!,0,0,"This is my favorite flavor of Ben & Jerry’s, & my favorite ice cream flavor I’ve tried. I like anything inspired by s’mores, and this ice cream did not dissapoint. I hope they keep this flavor around!"
4_bj,gotgotgone,2020-06-23,3,Smores Flavor is better,0,0,"I was not a fan of the toasted marshmallow Ice Cream. the chocolate cookie swirls, graham cracker swirls and fudge flakes are all wonderful fill ins. I wish they used a different tasting marshmallow"
4_bj,Julia711,2018-12-19,5,BY FAR BEST BEN & JERRYS FLAVOR,0,0,This is by far the best Ben & Jerry's flavor ever. Finally a s'mores flavor that realizes chocolate is not the star in a s'mores its the GRAHAM CRACKERS. PLEASE make this a permanent flavor!!!!!!!!
4_bj,lj3809,2018-06-27,5,PLEASE DON'T LESS THIS BE LIMITED,0,1,"This may be my new favorite flavor!! I seriously hope they keep this on forever as a flavor since it said limited batch. I didn't think I could like one more than Half Baked, but this may beat it"
4_bj,foodie29,2018-12-13,1,Very disappointing.,0,1,"I couldn't find the traditional ""S'mores"" flavor at the grocery store so, as a smores fan, I bought this one instead. What a disappointment! I literally took one bite and made a face because I did not like the flavor. I dug around for a minute looking for a marshmallow swirl.... nope, it's not there. Just small bits of chocolate cookie. What? How is this a smores ice cream? The base ice cream tastes nothing like marshmallow and certainly doesn't have the wonderful marshmallow texture the old ice cream had. Couldn't find anything resembling graham cracker here either, unlike the old one. This is just.... cookies and cream. And a pretty dull cookies and cream at that. This is not only nothing like smores, it is a dull ice cream."
4_bj,Redskull,2018-07-08,5,Amazing,0,0,I originally bought a pint of this flavor two weeks ago. We finished the first pint so fast that now we buy two every time we stock up on ice cream. I can’t wait to get s’more of this flavor.
4_bj,Cshh,2020-02-06,5,Best Icecream I've Ever Tasted,0,0,I'm so excited to see they're bringing this flavor back. It's been gone for about two years and I thought I'd never get my ice cream back. Thank you Ben and Jerry's for answering my prayers.

4_bj,Pepman,2020-03-28,5,One of the best flavors,0,0,"I have not tried all Ben and Jerry flavors, but have tried enough to rate this as one of the best. The hint of toasted marshmallow with chocolate and graham cracker are spot on."
4_bj,Notnowmaddie,2018-07-22,5,Holy s’mores!!,0,0,I’ve never made a review for any ice cream but this one deserves it!! Never been so disappointed about something being limited edition. This is my ultimate favorite ice cream.

4_bj,Middlear,2018-11-17,5,My new favorite flavor,0,0,"Excellent balance of chocolate to graham cracker. Could use more of a toasty note on the marshmallow, but favorite new flavor along with with the oat of this swirled flavor."
4_bj,oh_paulie,2020-08-18,1,They forgot the s'more!,0,1,"Terrible. s'mores are graham crackers, marshallow, chocolate. Gimme S'more has ZERO graham cracker taste. It's essentially just another vanilla ice cream with chocolate."
4_bj,Laurenisawesome,2018-07-10,5,Life changing,0,0,"This might be my new favorite. The taste and texture are amazing. The crunch of the graham cracker, chocolate swirls. I told my sister I would share, but there was no way."
4_bj,yummy yummy,2018-10-22,5,YUM,0,0,This flavor is so amazing. i’m a huge s’mores person and i couldn’t believe how amazing this was. B&J is my go to ice cream and i’ve offically found my go to flavor. YUM!

4_bj,ICConnoissuer,2020-06-19,2,Good but flavor not as advertised.,0,0,I was so excited to try this but the toasted marshmallow ice cream does not taste anything like marshmallows or any kind of toasted flavor. It’s more like regular cream.
4_bj,Mason,2018-08-01,5,So Good!,0,0,"This was so good! I'm not a fan of the chocolate based s'mores and really enjoyed the sweet cream base here. I do wish they had more graham cracker swirls, though."

4_bj,icecreamlover082018,2018-07-30,4,Good but no marshmallow flavor,0,0,This was good ice cream but I didn't get the smores flavor. I wasn't getting any marshmallow. If it was stronger it would be perfect. But it was good to eat!

5_bj,ChrisColby,2020-02-26,5,Peanut Butter makes everything better,10,1,"A flavor I'm glad to see back after liking it before it was discontinued, PB Half Baked is even better than I remembered. There's not much to say if youve already had the standard half baked. It works very similarly except that the vanilla portion of the flavor is now replaced with peanut butter ice cream, and the chocolate chip cookie dough is instead peanut butter cookie dough. For such slight changes though, they do make a big difference. One thing I disliked in the original half baked was how weak the vanilla base was and how it was completely dominated by the chocolate. That's not the case here as the peanut butter taste to the ice cream is strong enough to balance out the chocolate, giving the classic combination we know and love. The balance is also matched perfectly with the mix ins. There are HUGE brownie squares in this flavor, tasting great as always, and combined with the numerous peanut butter cookie dough pieces, you're getting the chocolate/peanut butter taste in every bite. If you're a fan of that flavor combination, you can't go wrong with Peanut Butter Half Baked."
5_bj,Nicoledobermanmom,2020-04-07,5,Best flavor EVER,2,0,Normally the tonight dough is my go to. I have been waiting for this flavor to get to my area and went it finally did I made sure run right to the store. I was in LOVE after the first bite . This is by far the best peanut butter ice cream flavor ever made. I beg and plead for this flavor to never go away because I am forever hooked. Thank you thank you thank you for my new favorite ever. This is a MUST TRY because you won’t look back
5_bj,lbrennan203,2020-07-03,5,Omg so delish!,1,0,"I bought this at a Ben & Jerry’s store a couple days ago in Sandbridge, VA and it was oh so good! I am a sucker for anything chocolate and peanut butter and this did not disappoint. My son took one lick and was jealous he did not pick it so we went back again last night and bought some for him! I love the peanut butter ice cream and fudge brownie and didn’t realize the cookie dough is peanut butter too, yum! Now that I am home from vacation I just need to find it near where I live!"
5_bj,BodybyBenandJerry,2020-08-01,5,THANK YOU!!!!!!,1,0,First of all I would like to say THANK YOU to whoever decided to put peanut butter in half baked! Half Baked is my favorite Ben & Jerry's flavor but I'm not a huge fan of vanilla ice cream... I just think the Peanut Butter ice cream really pairs well with the rest of the components in this mix. Dare I say... I might like this BETTER than the original Half Baked? It's too soon to tell. I love you Ben & Jerry!

6_bj,JennyWoof,2020-04-24,5,Berry good!,19,1,"All time favorite flavor! The berry flavored swirls of ice cream are perfectly delicately, but distinctly, flavored. The natural pastel purple that comes from the blackberries is definitely an adorable plus! The mascarpone ice cream swirls have that heavenly cheesecake-y taste, which combines with the soft crumbly shortbread to create a tiramisu-esque experience... but instead of the rich notes coming from cinnamon it comes from the crunchy fudge-covered almonds. May I suggest renaming this flavor to ""Chuck Berry Mascarpone"" after Chuck Berry: one of the pioneers of rock'n'roll."
6_bj,Lexi143,2020-07-30,5,Seriously The Best Ice Cream Ever,3,0,"This is without a doubt the best ice cream I have ever tried from Ben and Jerry's, and probably from anywhere at all! There is a B&J's scoop shop down the street from my apartment, one a couple miles away, and countless grocery stores in between. However, I constantly find myself driving out of the way to go to the only store in the area that I know stocks this flavor regularly. It is the perfect combination of flavors, and I have a really hard time keeping myself from going through the whole pint in one quick sitting. I will be absolutely devastated when this exclusive flavor is no longer available. Please keep it as a regular!!"
6_bj,Tr6nce,2020-05-21,5,Excellent,7,0,"A lot of recent flavors from Ben and Jerry's have left me disappointed but I saw this at Whole Foods and had to give it a go, because I'm like a Ben and Jerry's expert at this point. I thought it was going to be gross but I was pleasantly surprised by how all the flavors complimented each other. I left a few other people in the house have a small spoonful and they liked it as well. And to the person who said Strawberry Cheesecake is gone, you are wrong. That flavor is everywhere and never going away. Perhaps your store just stopped carrying it. It would be nice if they brought back the Blueberry Cheesecake flavor that was an exclusive at Walmart years ago. Anyway, Blackberry ice cream gets thumbs up from me!"
6_bj,JEM2021,2020-08-09,5,Love this!,1,0,This is my new favorite ice cream!!! It is absolutely delicious! I saw this at my local Whole Foods and decided to give it a try since I was craving ice cream with berries and I was so pleased when I got home and tried it. This flavor has just the right amount of sweetness and the flavor combo is to die for. The chocolate covered almonds and cookie bits not only add to the flavors but provide a great texture. I usually don't write reviews but this is so good and I'm afraid it will only be a limited time product. I hope they keep this one. I'll buy it forever. Recommending to all my family and friends.
6_bj,Dianamo in Dallas,2020-05-20,5,Sooooo good!,5,0,"I’m not even a big ice cream fan, but this is life changing!"
6_bj,jaiye,2020-07-08,5,my absolute favorite now!,2,0,"first of all--the pieces of cookie throughout the ice cream are EVERYTHING! I love the balance of flavors. It's so good. I'm actively searching for it which is the primary reason I ended up on this website, but figured I'd add a review and give it 5 stars to keep it on shelves."
6_bj,Anand,2020-07-26,5,My new favorite flavor!,2,0,"This is a great balance of flavors -- each one compliments the other and none of them are too over powering. Creamy, sweet, and a little fruity. I especially like that's it not jam packed with fixings and you get to taste the actual ice cream."
6_bj,Blugold,2020-07-22,5,Top 5,2,0,Great flavor combination. I wanted to try it because it was a new flavor and ended up loving it! Definitely in my top 5. My only criticism is that is it difficult to obtain.
6_bj,Cezanne,2020-09-23,5,Swept off my feet,0,0,"When I bought this flavor, I was hesitant to switch things up from my trusty flavor, The Tonight Dough. At night, I got peckish and searched the fridge until I remembered about this new flavor. I was in bed when I had my first bite, my only main regret."

8_bj,duckeeduck,2019-09-30,5,This needs to be a REGULAR flavor!,34,3,"Happened upon this at the grocery store, and knew I needed to get it. I've been enjoying Jen & Jerry's for decades, and my favorites before this were Cherry Garcia, Apple Pie a la Mode (from years ago - I heard this one couldn't be added to the reg. menu because the price of apples fluctuates too much), Chocolate Chip Cookie Dough, then Half-Baked, and more recently Cinnamon Buns. This one combines SO MANY of my favorites: cinnamon, dough, chocolate, brownies ... and now SPICE. YAS. I LOVE spiced and spicy chocolate, and what has been created here with this special edition is just EVERYTHING. PLEASE keep *churning* this one out!!! ;D It is simply the BEST."
8_bj,Puppylove,2019-12-14,5,Best Flavor! Please Add Permanently!’,20,1,I have been hooked on half baked for years now but this flavor changed everything! There’s just so much depth of flavor. I thought the spicy brownie would be too much but it’s very mild. I’d still prefer normal brownie but not by much. I love that the cinnamon ice cream and chocolate ice cream are two different ice creams swirled together. At first glance I thought it was going to be just chocolate ice cream with cinnamon flavor but I was wrong. Every bite is a unique balance of flavor that sends my tastebuds to heaven. I just wish it wasn’t a limited batch. I can’t go back to just half baked after this.
8_bj,MJamz,2019-11-01,4,Sooooo close!,8,0,"I really enjoyed this flavor--interesting, but not so far out there that I couldn't wrap my taste buds around it (I was a bit skeptical about the spice factor, but it was nice and mild). However, while the pint succeeded in taste, it fell short on execution (bad pun unintended, considering the name). The chocolate base was noticeably less dense than the cinnamon, and was riddled with tiny air bubbles. It still tasted great, but the creaminess was inconsistent, and likewise, there were plenty of dough gobs but only 3 big brownie chunks. Seems like Justice Remix'd just needed a a bit more balanced mixing.

Please keep this as a permanent flavor, instead of a limited batch. This is one of the best flavors you've designed in a long time (except for the sour sorbet this summer)."
8_bj,dennis333,2019-10-03,5,Please keep forever,18,2,"Oh man. I don't even seek out ice cream that often, but this flavor caught my eye and now I am an absolute fiend for it. I'm getting emotional thinking about this ice cream. I tell everyone I know to please try this ice cream. I sent out text messages to my family telling them to go buy this ice cream. I have never tasted anything like it in my life! Please keep it forever! I'm obsessed! (And of course I am also happy to hear about the nonprofit partnership.)"
8_bj,AmandaO,2019-09-16,5,Tastes like Abuelita hot chocolate!,27,1,"This is delicious. I didn't know what to expect when I read the description of the flavor, but OMG it's so good. It takes like the Abuelita brand hot chocolate with a little hint of spice from the brownies. I love it!"
8_bj,Kimpossible52891,2019-10-16,5,Best one so far!,16,0,I was a little nervous about the spicy brownies but oh my gosh! I love this flavor!! Please be a regular flavor not a limited batch!!! It’s so good!!!
8_bj,Jackson,2019-10-01,5,Possibly your greatest flavor ever.,17,1,"This hit every sweet spot for me. I'm serious. Absolutley loved this flavor, and I'm actually a little sad I tried it, because if it's a limited edition flavor that means it'll go away and never return. This needs a spot in the regular rotation. Don't make me go back to the store and hoard all of them."
8_bj,CinnamonLover,2020-02-02,5,Best Ice Cream so far!,3,0,"I love cinnamon more than any other flavour in general (in cakes, bubble gum, tequilla, porridge ... - you see, ice cream is certainly no exception), so i was really excited to try the ben & jerry's cinnamon bun, when I saw that flavour for the first time some years ago. Unfortunately, when it comes to ice cream, I strongly prefer chocolate over vanilla or caramel as a base, so I the cinnamon bun flavour didn't blow my mind completelly. Just 1 hour ago I saw THIS new flavour at a gas station and coudn't resist. It's even better than I expected, because the spiciness harmonize so well with the cinnamon & chocolate (that I always love). So I highly recommend this ice cream flavour to anyone, who really loves cinnamon in general and chocolate ice cream."
8_bj,SciFiLover,2019-11-25,5,The spicy fudge MWAH!,2,0,"The Ben & Jerry's line of ice cream is some of the best I have ever tasted. When I spied this, the newest in the freezer at my local grocery I was intrigued. So I ponied up my cash and brought it home. As usual, I popped the top and took a taste. OMG! I was floored. This has to be added to the line-up as a permanent option.It is everything I did not expect it to be. The flavors burst in your mouth! The combination of cinnamon and chocolate, although seemingly odd, are perfect together. And the ""topping on the cake"" is the spicy fudge brownie. Love this new flavor."
8_bj,tiffery,2019-12-11,5,I Need This Forever,4,0,"I can't stop buying this flavor. The balance of cinnamon ice cream, chocolate ice cream, tiny chunks of cinnamon bun dough, and bits of spicy brownie?! OH MY GOD. It's perfect. I saw a picture of this flavor online and then noticed it in my local grocery store, so I bought it. That was a month ago and now I can't stop. Please please please, Mr. Ben and Mr. Jerry I am begging you from my soul to keep this in the permanent rotation. JUSTICE TASTES DELICIOUS."
8_bj,James S,2019-09-25,5,amazing flavor! even more amazing cause,13,1,So glad to see B&J step it up on the activism front as well as on the taste buds front! This is a delicious ice cream
8_bj,Simsima,2019-11-19,5,Went back and bought every last pint,4,0,"This flavor combination is out of this world with perfect balance of flavors, textures and ... that cinnamon spice is everything. i wanted to try this initially because I support the cause and I was curious about how the flavor combo would be - and now I’m here begging you to add this to the regular rotation of flavors even though I never write reviews. I just went and bought out my local stores stock. Please add this to the regular line up!"
8_bj,Jcforever3,2020-01-22,4,Pretty good flavor! Worth trying.,2,0,"I saw this in the store and had to buy it as soon as I saw the words ""spicy brownie."" They weren't lying, the brownies have a really interesting kick! I can understand why it was too strong for some, but for me it made up for the lack of cinnamon promised in the ice cream and cinnamon bun dough (which basically was like their cookie dough in texture minus the chips). This is a flavor for people who like the classics but are bold enough to try out some more exotic ones. Overall, one of the most intriguing flavors I've had from Ben and Jerry's."
8_bj,ForTheLoveOfReMixd,2020-01-27,5,If This is Discontinued....,4,0,"I'm not sure I will ever love again! This is a fantasticly unusual combination that just hits every mark for me. I can usually ration out my pints over a couple weeks, but this flavor only lasts me two sittings! Anytime you need a break from the sugary cinnamon, the deep rich chocolate is there to smooth things over with a little spice and vice versa. I would definitely become a regular fanatic if this became a daily flavor (r.i.p. my diet)"
8_bj,Adam,2020-01-31,5,I LOVE this flavor,3,0,"It's so good! The cinnamon seems to pervade the entire pint and the spicy brownie bits are so tasty and interesting! I don't think that Ben and Jerry's has another flavor with a spicy element and I don't think that they need another one if they were to just keep this one around, which is exactly what they should do! I am gonna be so sad when they take this one away. I get that its kind of a weird flavor but it seems like the people who like it, REALLY love it."
8_bj,damien702,2019-10-20,5,Best new flavor yet,5,0,"This flavor is exactly what I didn’t know I needed, the cinnamon ice cream and hint of heat from the brownies really make it something special.

8_bj,RTK18,2020-05-06,5,Please Keep Making this Flavor,4,0,This is my favorite flavor ever. Its the only flavor I buy now when I get ice cream and I always buy 3 or 4 pints of it at a time out of fear it won't be there when I go to the store next. I love the cinnamon and spicy brownie combination. There isn't a substitute to this and I will actually cry when its no longer available.
8_bj,Emdog,2019-10-30,5,PLEASE KEEP THIS FLAVOR FOREVER,4,0,"I am in love with this ice cream as of many others I know, I always seem to become OBSESSED with a product when it is a “Limited edition” item.

8_bj,runlolarun,2019-10-13,5,Hands down best flavor,6,1,...and you will not change my mind. Its cruel and unusual that this is a limited edition batch.
8_bj,Franfran,2020-01-18,5,Great combination of flavors!,2,0,"This is the kind of pint that I could eat in one sitting, but have to hold back to save more for the next day. The combination of flavors are exquisite in my opinion!! Nothing to complain about for me. If you’re scared of the spicy chocolate, know it is not very spicy and quite delicious. THIS ICE CREAM NEEDS TO BE PERMANENT because I’ve realized I can’t live without it now. Please consider keeping it!!!!"

8_bj,AmyT,2020-05-29,5,Perfection!,1,1,"This flavor is complete perfection! It’s the perfect balance of chocolate and cinnamon. I love the spicy brownie (not too spicy) and the cinnamon roll. I just keep buying multiple pints every time I go to a grocery store because this flavor is almost singlehandedly getting me through the stress of working during the pandemic. As an added bonus to the delicious flavor, the nonprofit connection is for criminal justice reform - ice cream doesn’t get any better than this! I hope you add it as a permanent flavor!"
8_bj,Victoriarla,2020-01-04,5,One of my favorites!,2,0,At first I didn't feel the spice from the brownie but when it's eaten alone its definitely there. This flavor is sooo good. I wish it would be a permanent flavor.
8_bj,Sm56,2020-01-17,4,Love this one,2,0,I was really excited to try this one when I heard about it I love the spicy sweet aspect and really wish they would make this one of the regular flavors
8_bj,Dooodlebops,2020-02-05,3,Spicy brownies I love,2,0,The ice creams are blah but the spiced up brownies saved the pint...until I ate it. All.
8_bj,Barbara,2020-02-17,5,Happy Surprise,2,1,"My curiousity stopped on the label at 'gobs of cinnamon bun dough', so I didn't even notice the ""spicy fudge brownie"" part. Turned out I don't actually like the little cinnamon dough buttons (easy to spit out), but the spicy brownies really made this worth the purchase. I hope they revisit it again, Loving the cinnamon/spicy chocolate combo."
8_bj,,2019-10-02,3,Too spiced,4,2,The icecream itself and the cinnamon buns were good but the brownie was too strongly spiced.
8_bj,Icecreamman1,2020-02-29,5,The Most Interesting Flavor,2,1,"I haven't found a new ice cream flavor like this in awhile. I would love to have it permanently, because it is my fave flavor currently! Very odd, but satisfying. The spiciness of the brownies works perfect with the sweetness of the mix of the cinnammon bun dough and ice cream. I'd love to see more creativity like this in my ice cream!"
8_bj,hslagle,2020-06-21,5,The best ice cream ever. Make it permanent!!,1,0,Ever since this ice cream has come out I always have a pint of it in the fridge. Seriously right now I have 3. Not only is this my favorite ice cream of all time but it also supports a great cause so maybe we can be lucky enough to keep this pint because as long as you guys make it I will keep buying it.
8_bj,antaresoceana,2020-03-26,2,Just didn't do it for me but I really wish it did,1,1,"I was more disappointed in myself than I was in this ice cream. I really wish I liked it. I really do. All the mix-ins were right up my alley. I don't know where my taste buds took a wrong turn. I had visions of a cinnamon roll with spicy hot chocolate to wash it down, but instead it was like a roller derby of playfully competitive flavours fighting each other to win. In turn, they ended up too black and blue to discern who was who. :'("
8_bj,Jessban507,2020-01-30,5,This ice cream cured my depression,2,1,NEEDS TO BE A PERMANENT FLAVOR! I can’t believe there’s a flavor that combines my favorites— cinnamon bun with Half Baked. Every bite was so interesting and delightful. A whole pint goes down eeeeasy. I hope I can find this again. DEFINITELY a new favorite.
8_bj,RiccoColdBrew,2020-02-19,5,Addicted To CinnaBuns & Chocolate Ice Cream,2,1,Was first time trying and I'm addicted the spicy fudge brownies paired with the sweet chocolate ice cream and cinnamon bun dough is to die for thanks @Ben&Jerry's for the best I've cream always - Ricco
8_bj,Veggiesaurus,2020-04-29,1,"Yuck, spicy brownies!",3,10,"The flavors did not go well together AT ALL. It sounded interesting so I decided to give it a try. I like spicy food but the spicy brownie mixed with the strong cinnamon flavor was vile. If I had very much of it, I Would be nauseous . The second I bit in to the brownie, I thought “this is disgusting “. Absolutely the worst Ben & Jerry’s flavor I have tried and the worst flavor of ANY ice cream I’ve ever tried.GROSS."
8_bj,CharChar,2020-02-13,5,My favorite flavor yet!,1,0,"Oh my gosh, I loooooooove the mixture of chocolate and spicy brownies! It reminds of Mexican hot cocoa. I vote to keep this flavor forever!"
8_bj,Liza,2020-06-23,5,Please keep!,1,0,"Please make this a permanent flavor. It’s one of the most unique, delicious flavors you’ve ever produced."
8_bj,Katienesbitt85,2020-01-25,5,It’s soooo good!,1,0,"If you like Mexican hot chocolate, you’ll like this! It’s delicious!"
8_bj,SetterMom,2020-04-06,1,Not Working,4,5,The cinnamon spice is way too aggressive - tastes more like strong gingerbread - and the flavor doesn’t pair well with the chocolate at all.
8_bj,Jesika Tracy,2020-03-06,5,PLEASE KEEP THIS FOREVER,1,0,New favorite ice cream. Ate all of it in one night. Heck yeah
8_bj,willowmiri,2020-03-30,5,!! My favorite !!,0,0,This is the combination of all of my favorite things and I'm so happy. It is so delicious and I hope Ben and Jerry's never stops making it. I'd always wondered about the lack of Ben and Jerry's cinnamon ice cream because it's my absolute favorite -- and Justice Remix'd knocked it out of the park. Everything is so cinnamony and chocolately. I love the chunks. SO GOOD.
8_bj,HHarper148,2020-07-18,5,This flavor does ice cream JUSTICE!,0,0,"I bought this a week ago because it sounded delicious. After finishing the first one a couple days ago I just had to get another. I had to go to two stores to get one and learned it's a limited batch. I LOVE cinnamon ice cream, mix that with cinnamon bun dough and spicy brownies and it is heaven on earth. PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE add this to your line of regularly available flavors. I would hate to lose it as quickly as I discovered it."
8_bj,mchrisman01,2020-03-08,3,Parts of it are good.,0,1,The cinnamon ice cream and chocolate ice cream are great. And the cinnamon bun dough is out of this world!! But the spicy brownie in it overpowers everything. I end up picking it out of the ice cream. Honestly either the brownie needs to be taken out all together or the brownie needs to be a plain brownie instead of a spicy one. There is also so much brownie in it so it could also stand to be toned down in that regard as well
8_bj,IceCreamMan99,2020-06-15,1,Why????,0,0,"I got this flavor by accident. Had done curbside pickup at the grocery, but instead of Phish Food, I received this. It sat in the freezer for about a week and decided to try it. I honestly feel like my taste buds were being punished, as if i lost a bet and was forced to eat this. If fear factor created an ice cream flavor, this would be it. None of the flavors work together. The cinnamon is too strong. Would be better if it tasted more like a cinnamon roll than the cinnamon challenge from a few years back. The spicy brownie makes no sense. The flavor is so off putting, i wanted to gag. They could have easily used some sort of Mexican hot chocolate flavor and it would have been so much better. I really have no words except this is one of the most vile and disgusting flavors I have ever eaten. Save your money and make a donation to your favorite social justice charity."
8_bj,lilsnackfiend,2020-06-06,5,Singing to the Tune of Justice,0,0,"Not only does this ice cream flavor support a I cause important to me, but it's an amazing texture and flavor combo. That spicy ribbon of fudgy brownie?! Those cinnamon roll chunks?! My tongue is dancing to this beat. How does this not have an average of 5 stars already? It's the remix I needed. Play it again! Make it a permanent member on the Ben & Jerry's Flavor Playlist."
8_bj,Giggle box,2020-02-22,5,Omg heaven,1,1,I wish this flavor was around year round I never knew I needed this in my life until I unlowingky took a bite into the most heavenly thing I’ve ever eaten. I LOVE IT
8_bj,Jennjennjenny,2020-06-11,5,You had me at cinnamon,0,0,Went looking for Justice Remix'd ice cream because of a facebook post that led me to Ben & Jerry's civic and social commitment. The Ice cream happens to contain a cinnamon and brownie deliciousness that I love and is hard to find together. A true surprise and delight. Thank you so much and if the blueberry one comes about I know I'll like that one too.
8_bj,DocGfin,2020-06-26,5,A great message on a great icecream.,0,0,"So many ice creams these days are one trick ponies: sweet on sweet on sweet. A well balanced dessert needs multiple notes. This delivers. Warm cinnamon, spicy brownies, bitter chocolate and of course smooth sweet Ben and Jerry's icecream."
8_bj,EnglishLitDoc,2020-02-21,1,Too sweet,3,8,Sugary and not great. This is probably my least favorite flavor I have ever had of Ben and Jerry's.
8_bj,Rika,2020-01-16,1,Really wanted to like it...,2,5,I wanted to like this flavor so badly but I just didn’t. The spicy brownie ruined it for me. I ended up digging out the brownie and just eating the rest.
8_bj,,2020-08-29,3,I Can't Remember This,0,0,"I know I bought this, but I can't remember it. So that means that A. it's not horrible and B. it's not outstanding. Kind of like a blind date who is certain to end up with someone decent and you wish him the best, but he's not for you. I'd probably buy it again just to make sure I wasn't intoxicated the first time and that's why I forgot."
8_bj,Steevn,2020-02-19,1,God awful,9,60,Just bought this and took three bites and I couldn’t swallow any more this is the most disgusting ice cream I’ve ever had I don’t know how it made it to the shelves
8_bj,lulu7777,2020-01-05,1,Justice Remix,4,14,I love Ben & Jerry's however this one is not for me..Dissapointed.
8_bj,lemmingade,2020-01-03,1,"Good cause, bad f!avor!",3,13,Super icky. I've never thrown away an almost full pint of Ben &Jerry's before The cinnamon flavor was too strong and the spicy brownies absolutely unpleasant.
8_bj,MAGAzine lover,2020-06-17,1,Grooosssss,3,11,"Don't waste your time. Much like protests, the whole thing is ruined by disgusting spicy chocolate!"
8_bj,Nettieb,2020-01-16,5,My new favorite,0,0,"I love this flavor so much that it is now my official go to! The surprising bite of spicy brownie is so delicious! I was hesitant to try it because I can't do too spicy anymore, but this has just a small amount of spice which oddly balances with the sweet! I hope this becomes a part of the permanent collection!"
8_bj,Moni,2020-06-29,5,Not a chocolate fan,0,0,"I’m not a chocolate fan at all, but I love cinnamon so I decided to give this flavor a try and im glad I did!! The chocolate wasn’t overwhelming and the cinnamon mellowed it out. I loved the chunks of spicy fudge and cinnamon bun dough. This was super creative and perfectly executed"
8_bj,Ashley0908,2020-07-07,5,Incredible mission,0,0,"Thank you for using your platform for good. Ice cream flavours are incredible with real ice cream! It amazes me how socially responsible this company is. I 100% recommend this brand to everyone I know any chance I get. Incredible flavours, incredible missions, worth the price! "
8_bj,Volvomom,2020-04-03,5,"Amazing, unique taste!",0,0,"I'll admit - the colorful packaging and good cause drew me in. Who knew that the cinnamon that lingers would be the thing that keeps me walking back to the fridge each night around 9:30pm? I'm not an ice cream addict, but this flavor is more like a gourmet treat. Indulge!"
8_bj,Danny311,2020-06-26,1,Horrible.,1,2,Probably the worst ice cream that has ever been created. Absolutely disgusting
8_bj,Acedar608,2020-02-06,5,So Uniquely Yummy,0,0,I love Ben and Jerry's because their ice cream is delicious and because they support good causes. This flavor looked interesting and I like knowing that a portion of the money I spent might help make a difference. I ended up eating the whole pint in one sitting
8_bj,Briguy,2020-05-19,5,Good stuff.,0,0,"If you don't like the flavor profile, chances are you won't like this pint of ice cream. However, if it sounds good to you like it does to me, pretty sure you'll enjoy this ice cream. My only complaint is I wish it had more of the spicy fudge brownie pieces"
8_bj,Shayshay06,2020-04-24,1,Ehhhhh,1,3,I was so excited to try this but it was absolutely terrible. It made my stomach hurt and I literally was nauseous.

The spicy chocolate and everything is amazing. I went back and bought our grocer out. Please make it permanent. :)"
8_bj,Lisalue49,2020-04-12,5,Yummy cinnamon!,0,0,What a change of pace! Not a huge fan of chocolate but the cinnamon gives it a good balance. What's B&J without something gooey? Oh yes! Gooey gobs of cinnamon bun dough and brownies! Even the brownies are magical! The taste bursts on my tongue!
8_bj,Ggmg,2020-04-01,1,Awful,1,4,"The flavor combination is disgusting, obviously no real thought went into this ice cream and I doubt anyone taste tested it."
8_bj,maiab,2020-06-17,4,Not what I expected but really good!,0,0,I didn’t really know what to expect with this flavor and it was different but still super good. It is pretty powerful on the cinnamon and with the spicy brownies but everything complemented super well together. Would probably buy again.

8_bj,Casiecase,2020-06-06,5,The best flavor,0,0,This is seriously such a good flavor. The brownie in it has enough cinnamon to give it a kick but isn’t overbearing and the little cinnamon bun bits are phenomenal.

9_bj,lainey_moto109mx,2020-08-14,5,DUUUUUDEEEE...,3,0,"I’m just gnna say. This one makes me wanna sit on the couch and just smile n dance like a chunky little kid gettin’ their ice cream shimmy on!!! The chocolate ice cream, for some reason, tastes so dang good in this batch! The toffee bits are such an awesome touch to it. The fudge cows, another awesome texture element with a hit of a nice bittersweet dark chocolate to contrast the sweet/salty toffee crunch and silky smooth milk chocolate ice cream. But the dang killer here is....... that SUGAR COOKIE CORE. WHOA B&J... ur just showing off now. That stuff.... is like.. out of this world (; U should really put a litttlleee more in the pint hehe! :D
But anywho, it’s Uber yummy!! Wouldn’t be surprised if it became a next hit and stuck around!"

I was worried this would be too sweet but has the perfect balance of chocolate, toffee, fudge, and sugar cookie core. The sugar cookie core is not overbearing like some other core flavors. I also love the that the texture is both smooth and crunchy. I hope this become permanent"
9_bj,Amanda530,2020-08-23,1,Good idea but weird,0,9,"I was excited to try this new flavor last week. What's not to love about fudge cows, toffee, and sugar cookie. Unfortunately for me it was a major flop. The ice cream and fudge cows were enjoyable. The toffee clusters were a weird texture experience, unfortunately. I was expecting something more along the lines of the toffee in Everything But The.... which I really enjoy. The real disappointment, and reason I'm actually taking the time to review ice cream, was the sugar cookie dough core. For me, it just tasted of wet sugar. Grainy, too soft, no flavor. Ben and Jerry's has set high expectations for their products, but sadly this one didn't deliver for me."
9_bj,Bjaxx1992,2020-07-09,5,BEST ICE CREAM EVER.,6,0,The combination of flavors in this ice cream is OUT OF THIS WORLD! I was lucky enough to find one pint and have been searching for more. I really hope this becomes a regular flavor because I’m obsessed. I’ve been checking all the stores nearby and everywhere is sold out. Please please please keep this one around!

I was nervous because myself and my partner are not usually chocolate ice cream lovers but this one has changed our minds!! The cookie core and other bits balance out the chocolate ice cream PERFECTLY. I've been trying to track it down again since but it seems people have caught on to it and it's been sold out. You have to try it!

It sounded good and I love supporting them and also Space Force, so I had to buy it. I am not kidding when I say this is literally the best flavor I’ve ever had.

Got one for me and one for my wife, and we both thought it was fan-freaking-tastic. It even has a hint of malt flavor, whether unintentional or due to a confluence of other ingredients. I'd have trouble choosing between this and Phish Food, and that's saying something! I'd be even more stoked if you could make a froyo version, 'cuz the reduced calories and saturated fat would let me eat it more often!"

I pe this flavor because it is BY FAR the best tasting Ben and Jerry’s flavor ever made, no competition... and i amd a huge Ben and Jerry’s fan. The reason I hate it is because this flavor has caused me to gain like 30 lbs at this point because I cannot stop eating it. It does not get old. Ever. The crunchy sweetness of the toffee is spot on amd just pairs PERFECTLY with the sugar cookie core and the milk chocolate ice cream. Oh yeah, MILK CHOCOLATE. The milk chocolate is so good. I have eaten probably like 50 of these at this point and everytime the core is big and i never get a bad core. Every pint i have gotten has been just as good ig not better than the last. Please Ben amd Jerry’s. If you are reading this. DO NOT MAKE THIS A LIMITED TIME FLAVOR."

I hope that this becomes a regular flavor, as it is now my favorite chocolate ice cream based B&J pint. My fav of all time will always be Salted Caramel Core, but this is a close second. Definitely for caramel and toffee fans, I even loved the sugar cookie core."
9_bj,MizoMetar,2020-09-15,5,Shockingly Good,0,0,"I am not the biggest ice cream fan but I do like a good dessert, but this was everything I could have wanted from a dessert, creamy chocolate, a nice crunch of cookies and toffee, a smooth flavor that wants me going back for more. If your a fan of texture and something out of the ordinary give this a try, I know I did and I cannot wait to get more."
9_bj,Charles V,2020-09-10,5,Until this becomes a regular flavor...stockpile.,0,0,When I first discovered this I was on the East Coast. Found it in a tiny gas station. After one scoop I immediately made plans to go back and buy the place out. Bought the remaining three pints the next day. We only had a week left on our trip but I had no issues finishing all 4 pints.
9_bj,Peach,2020-06-07,5,Chip Happens,3,15,Just tried chip happens..yummy! Don't know how you managed the chips in it but love the salty/sweet combo. Reminds me of b-day's as a child
9_bj,MegA,2020-09-20,5,My ABSOLUTE FAVORITE!!,0,0,I love this flavor SO MUCH! It's such a bummer when the limited time flavors are the best flavors. I still think about the 2016 Empower-mint. Please keep this one going. And maybe bring back the Empower-mint?

10_bj,Coleman,2018-05-13,5,Perfect harmony,12,2,"I loved this ice cream so much I typed in Ben and Jerry's Americone Dream is amazing into Google. I wanted to add a review since there was only one so far... To my surprise the cone was still crispy and the amount of fudge covering the cone was not overwhelming whatsoever. But the caramel swirl is fantastic quality, bringing back memories of the first time I had caramel with a side of Apple. I chose this because I was looking for a non traditional flavor but not too rich, now don't get me wrong, eating half a pint is definitely a hefty load on the gut but it doesn't feel too busy and you still get to enjoy the ice cream."
10_bj,sgai,2017-11-05,5,Current fav BJ flavor,6,0,I've gone back to this flavor after favoring The Tonight Dough and the Caramel Core ones. I forgot what I was missing. I bought 2 the last time they were BOGO at Publix and go 2 more before the sale ended. I love caramel(I hate fudge) and the crispy chocolate covered waffle cones are tasty. Also I don't see many other options with waffle cone pieces. There have also been a lot of waffle cone in the pints.
10_bj,LeeLee,2017-09-30,5,Delicious,10,0,"Tastes good, satisfies my sweet tooth, and definitely represents the Americone Dream!!!!

In fact, if it isn't coffee or chocolate I am usually not a fan at all; however, Americone Dream is a mix of fabulous flavors! No toppings or modifications are needed to make this a tasty treat for my son and I. The touch of waffle cone is a nice addition (though crunchier cone would be even better). Thanks for making a great ice cream!"

10_bj,Mimi232,2020-06-17,5,FAVORITE,1,0,"So between this and the new Gimme S’mores. It’s a TIE. I honestly can’t decide which one I like more. But this has been one of my favorites before Gimme S’mores. I love Americone Dream so much The ice cream and the caramel ripple and the chocolate covered cone parts is AMAZING.
Whoever said this needed more salt it DOES NOT. It is perfect the way it is. I found no issues with the crunchy part either.
It has the perfect amount of caramel perfect amount of crunch and chocolate ratio. This is like a drumstick but with more of that “good part”."
10_bj,PhishFoodLUVR,2017-09-09,2,Could be delicious if revised,6,4,"It would be fantastic if the texture were better and it had something to balance out the sweet. Replacing plain caramel for salted caramel, or adding sea salt to the chocolate. Switching to dark chocolate. The cone pieces felt chewy or doughy, and I expected a crunch. Though I do suspect this has more to do with the freezing process. I'd like it a lot more if it was only one of these. While I don't care for it, I can see why lots of people love it. Good job!!"
10_bj,Maggie1198,2018-05-15,1,Americone Slice,2,7,I chose this flavor for the caramel swirl as much as the fudge covered cone pieces...sadly it contained neither

You haven't just ""not tried it"", you haven't even started living. It is life giving. Fix it. Go forth. Brave the great wide world in search of the truth of the universe.

10_bj,Elyse,2018-07-07,5,Out of This World!,0,0,"This is one of the most delicious flavors of ice cream I’ve ever eaten. It’s sweet, crunchy, wonderfully gooey, with pieces of waffle cone, fudge, and caramel goodness. To make it even better, the proceeds go The Stephen Colbert’s AmeriCone Dream Fund, which feeds hungry children, provides them with medication, and also provides services to veterans. For what more could you ask? You’ll love it and feel good about helping those in need."
10_bj,chase,2018-04-12,3,Least favorite B&J,0,0,"I'm new to B&J icecream, just got a whole bunch of flavors last month and out of ~10 this is my least favorite.
The good: The icecream is high quality, and what you would expect from B&Js, and the caramel was gooey and tasty.
The bad: The cone pieces had a soggy texture and were very unpleasant to eat, they were slightly chewy. Not sure if this is a result of my freezer or something, but I couldn't finish the whole pint."

10_bj,ashleyv150,2020-07-26,4,,0,0,"A good flavor! It's pretty simple- vanilla with caramel and fudge-covered waffle cone pieces- but sometimes that's all you need! I've definitely purchased this flavor more than once. The only slight flaw- and this wasn't an issue the last time I purchased it so maybe it got a bit better- was that the waffle cone pieces could be a bit too big sometimes. I'd still highly recommend it, though!"
10_bj,,2020-07-28,4,,0,0,"This Ben & Jerry's was good, but not my favorite of their line. Idk if it's the label or the actual ice cream. I think it needs someone else on the label who doesn't hate our current president. I'm a repeat consumer, but I won't buy again because of that. I love America regardless of who our president is, but overall the flavor is actually great like all ben & Jerry's"

The chocolate covered cone pieces and yummy, but the texture of the caramel is bad, i love caramel swirls in icecream but this light almost slime textured caramel really bothered me, i tried to.mix it in more or somethinh but it was like biting into a cold slime ball i couldn't eat it. But the rest of the icecream was great"
10_bj,makeupsbymarie,2018-11-19,4,,0,0,I’ve always loved Ben & Jerry’s. I really like this flavor. It’s really sweet and all of these flavors together are amazingly good. The only bad thing about this flavor is that the ice cream cone chunks are soggy. Either than that it’s super good and I recommend! It’s an ice cream that you can get an upset tummy over because it’s not too much chocolate!

10_bj,lalalamb,2020-07-31,4,,0,0,This is my favorite Ben & Jerry flavor! It's the perfect amount of sweet for my sugar cravings. I like the waffle cone bits which give it a crunch and some texture. I give it 4 stars instead of 5 because some batches tend to have soft pieces of waffle cone. The waffle cones are not consistently crunchy with every pint i buy.

Its so worth it though. I think my favorite part is the waffle cone pieces. My only complaint is that there isnt enough caramel, but thats just because I love caramel."
10_bj,sighrijaa,2020-06-22,5,,0,0,The best combination of things. I like vanilla based things more than chocolate ice cream based things and so I stay away from a lot of Ben and Jerrys flavors because most are the latter. This is great for a vanilla lover. With pieces of fudge and caramel (waffle cone pieces). The gooey-ness is real and drool worthy. YUM.

These pints are packed with flavor - mainly because while developing the product Ben, who suffered from a disease that left him unable to smell, couldnt taste the flavor of the ice cream! So, they just kept adding flavor! Which turned out GREAT for us."
10_bj,ichbineinmaron,2018-12-04,5,,0,0,I love this brand of ice cream. I have no complaints with any flavors from this company. Growing up we lived near a Ben & Jerry's and that was our treat.

11_bj,Twilli31,2017-12-06,5,Best of both worlds!,6,0,Being from southwest Louisiana we love our pecan pie and ice cream. This ice cream has all the flavor of the south. Always heartbreaking when the store is out of their limited stock of it. Please ship it to my house all year long lol
11_bj,busymom,2017-05-22,5,So tasty,8,2,"I love this ice cream! The first bite always tastes sweet with a hit of bourbon, then add in the nuts, and the short bread, and you have delicious complexity, with a nice crunch."

11_bj,Storm,2018-02-12,5,Southern Style Ice Cream,2,0,Bourbon Pecan Pie Ice Cream can't get enough. The bourbon makes the ice cream.
11_bj,KimBeth,2020-02-23,5,Yee Haw!,1,0,Excellent ice cream! Whiskey can sometimes overpower all the ingredients--this ice cream has a great balance of flavor and the whiskey is not to overpowering. Here is the problem--I bought this ice cream in an outlet store in California so I fear that Bourbon Pecan Pie will be in the Ben & Jerry flavor grave yard soon. It was a great flavor while it lasted though.
11_bj,Love,2018-01-15,1,Disappointing bourbon pecan pie ice cream,3,32,I absolutely HATE this ice cream I thought they brought bake SOUTHERN PECAN PIE!!!! That's why I bought this bourbon mess it's not even close to being as good as the southern pecan pie ice cream I'm from Dallas Tx I know pecan pie when I taste it this ice cream didn't do it for me I will be returning it way too much Carmel in the ice cream it's self I've had better Ben and jerrys ice cream
11_bj,CP93,2020-03-01,5,One of my top two favorites,0,0,"This is one of my top two favorite flavors from B&J, and the other is long gone (the late, lamented Wavy Gravy)."
12_bj,JBlack16,2018-01-23,5,Very Impressed,14,0,I love Brewed to Matter! So thing about the coffee ice cream mixed with brownie batter and chocolate chunks does it for me. Although I am worried with it being a exclusive flavor it may be discontinued. Please keep this in the Ben and Jerry’s line up!
12_bj,VanessaB99,2020-03-24,2,Unbalanced and disappointing,0,3,"I can see that the inspiration for this flavor came from a fancy coffee drink like a frozen mocha or Frappuccino. However the balance of flavors & textures is off for my taste. There's not enough coffee flavor. The coffee flavor would be improved by using the cold brew method instead of coffee extract. The extract brings an unpleasant aftertaste. The chocolate chunks are too big and dominating. There's not enough brownie swirl and it's not as prominent of ""brownie"" flavor or texture as in other pints. While this flavor idea is good, I think the execution definitely needs to be adjusted. I still love Ben & Jerry's! I'm just not a fan of this pint."
12_bj,Alex,2017-04-20,5,The perfect flavor,13,0,"Okay Ben and Jerry's, you can stop making new flavors. This one is perfect."
12_bj,iamright,2018-04-05,5,Perfect,10,0,My girlfriend isn't a fan of this and I think that she is so wrong in every regard that I am writing this review just out of spite and also because this is the perfect ice cream and deserves all of the stars.
12_bj,anon,2017-10-30,5,Best flavor on the planet,5,0,"This is by far my favorite flavor, of all time. A decade ago, brownie batter was a flavor that was available as pints and I would get that and eat around the fudge brownie chunks because it was worth it. But this flavor is everything. Please never stop making this flavor! It is the end all be all of flavors. Thank you so much for making this ice cream!!"
12_bj,Lexi,2017-08-31,5,Amazing,3,0,"I bought this flavor one time at Target because it was the closest one to a java chip flavor, and it changed my life. It was so good. I searched up and down for it though and couldn't find it for a few months in any other store, and since then had moved. I just found it tonight in another target location and jumped for joy in the store. My favorite ice cream flavor by far! Wish it came in a bigger size..."
12_bj,BeachChick017,2018-04-12,5,My All Time Favorite,2,0,"I absolutely love this flavor. It is beyond perfect and no other flavor can even begin to compare! Unfortunately, it is an exclusive flavor only sold at Target. I’ll buy 2 or 3 when I find them in stock. I will go out of my way to go to target specifically for this flavor and 4 out of 5 times, they are out of the flavor. And the stock guy told me that there isn’t any on order and none coming with the next delivery. Can anybody please help!"
12_bj,Jjphoenix21,2019-12-26,5,Have never love Ice cream so much,0,0,I absolutely love this flavor! I have never loved a flavor as much as brewed to matter. My son loves it as well. As someone mentioned before I can only purchase at 1 store and I ask at all the other stores that are closer to order it. I never have seen it at those stores. But we absolutely LOVE THIS ONE!!!!!
12_bj,antaresoceana,2020-03-26,5,So Have a Pint of Ice Cream and Catch Your Breath,0,0,"I should heed my own advice because this flavour truly took my breath away. Coffee ice cream is my all-time, hands-down favourite type of ice cream that is reliably available. Coffee ice cream with chocolate syrup to be specific. So this pint? It does it all for me man. It does all of the heavy lifting, it unscrews the jar lids that are on too tight, and it even pumps my gas for me when it's raining out. I didn't even need to think about exerting an iota of effort to get the flavour profile of this pint exactly where I wanted it. Didn't even need to turn location services on. A++"
12_bj,FuzzyGut,2018-10-02,4,Yum,1,0,"Nothing wrong here! Yummy coffee ice cream base and a great tasting fudge swirl. The chocolate chunks are a good addition.

12_bj,Tubs123,2018-07-16,4,Reminds me of mocha,1,0,I really liked this coffee flavor! I have tried a few of the other coffee flavors and this one is probably my favorite! There was plenty of brownie swirl and fudge chunks that paired really well with the coffee ice cream! I would definitely try this flavor again!
12_bj,j_judd29,2018-06-17,5,Best flavor of all Time,1,0,I love coffee ice cream and I usually by a store brand one called java chunk that is similar but once I tried brewed to matter I'll never go back. I love everything about it and I hope it never goes away please tell me this is going to stick around!!!!!
12_bj,Arpanda88,2018-08-26,5,My new favorite!,1,0,So my favorite ice cream flavor has always been coffee. But my favorite Ben and Jerry’s flavor has always been chocolate fudge brownie. This ice cream brings favorites together! Please make this a permanent fixture in the Ben and Jerry’s line up!
12_bj,Birdmann,2018-01-03,5,Draws us to Target,1,0,A wonderful coffee and chocolate ice cream with a nice mix of flavors and textures. We shop at Target sometimes just because that's the only place we can get it. Our favorite B&J flavor since Toffee Heath Bar Crunch went away.
12_bj,TexasMom,2018-03-29,5,The most perfect ice cream.,1,0,I make up reasons to go to Target to get this ice cream. It is simply perfect. I keep thinking it will get old and I will switch to my other favs. But I just.... never.... do.

12_bj,Sam222,2018-05-27,4,Easily in my top 3 favorites,1,1,This flavor is my go to at my local Target. Recently the past 3 times I bought this flavor there is very little brownie batter and an abundance of fudge chucks. Which is disappointing because the brownie batter is the best part!
12_bj,Phish Food Fan,2019-02-07,5,Coffee? Fudge Yes!,0,0,"This is just a really great flavor! Ben and Jerry’s does the best coffee ice cream base flavors of brand available and this is no exception. The fudge flakes taste great and give a textural contrast to the smooth, creamy ice cream. The brownie-fudge is, of course, delicious and completes a perfect pint. If you like coffee and fudge then take a trip over to Target and grab a pint or 4."

12_bj,Icecreamfan4life,2018-06-26,3,Le Sigh...,0,1,"Welp, I finally broke down and bought this flavor that I've often seen mentioned on the site(wasn't quite in my usual buying locales til recently). And figured since a friend of mine told me how awesome she found this flavor or I think another coffee flavor by B&J's to be really great. I figured I would give it a whirl and try it as a ""breakfasty"" sort of option for a change. I mean it has coffee in it right? Figured it would perk me up a bit more before work. Add in the chocolate and sugar in general, I figured I would be good to go. But unfortunately I was wrong. The coffee flavor wasn't quite as strong(save for on 2/3's of the top of the pint, to the point of me not being able to tell if the fudge pieces were plain fudge flavor or expresso flavored), even appreciated the thinner fudge pieces. But hardly got any of the brownie swirl flavor until I was a 1/4 of the way done with the pint. Not to mention, after consuming a good half of the pint before work, I would have thought I'd have some get up and go(which I tend to get in general off of coffee flavored ice creams). But I had a good 10 to 15 min bit of pep before I crashed and wanted to nap so hard even before I left the house. So in other words, me thinks this flavor is going to be a no can do for me in the future. And would recommend it to folks that like coffee flavored ice creams you can eat at night and still get a good night's rest afterward."
13_bj,Bridgespo99997,2019-02-02,2,Could be amazing.,8,0,"The cheese cake ice creams could be amazing, but for some reason the one thing wrong with the ice cream is the cheesecake balls. The balls taste very chemical and just not right. Overall I scooped around them. While the carmel flavor really lacked in this ice cream, and the chocolate cookie swirl was very little and almost nonexistent. I am very disappointed with how all of the cheesecake truffles have turned out. Overall, the truffles ruin the ice cream and need to be reformulated. While I am disappointed that this ice cream lacked swirl and Carmel. What could be amazing, was ruined by lack of and truffles."
13_bj,Tr6nce,2020-05-29,2,Flavor's okay but..,4,0,"The flavors work for the most part. Ben & Jerry's ice creams with the graham cracker swirl are my personal favorites but this one left much to be desired. My main problem are the truffles, in this flavor in particular. The truffles seem to be frozen until you bite into them and then it's soft. I can't really enjoy the truffles if I'm too worried about the cold shock to my gums from parts of the ice cream being unexpectedly frozen in random places. I'm used to thinks like strawberries in the cheesecake to be frozen, but then something like the truffles that should be soft like the cookie dough is frozen, I can't really enjoy it."
13_bj,kuroyuuki,2018-06-11,3,Like everything but the cheesecake truffles,11,1,"First of all, let me just say that I love this truffle craze that has been going on and made a point to try every option. For this flavor, I love mostly everything about this: the ice cream, the swirls, the exterior of the truffles. However, I do not like the cheesecake interior of the truffles. The cheesecake flavoring is already there through the ice cream, but the cheesecake part of the truffles does not retain the coldness of the ice cream and doesn't fit. I think a chocolate interior would have probably worked better. Would not buy again unless I felt the desire to eat everything but the truffle."
13_bj,MJamz,2020-04-17,4,Redemption!,1,0,"I feel like this remake of the old cheesecake truffle flavor totally snuck in under the radar--and a shame, because it's such an upgrade! Where the truffles were the downfall of the old version (no offense, Ben & Jerry), the new cheesecake pieces are exactly what I look for in a cheesecake ice cream mix-in. They're not liquidy and greasy like the truffles, but actually have a fluffy chew to them, and they taste great! A couple pieces even had a toasty crust on them. On the downside, the cookie crumble swirls were really thin, but I *almost* didn't even mind, because I came for the cheesecake on this one, and I got it!"
13_bj,TheFeistyTeddyBear,2019-07-03,1,Definitely misses the mark.,4,6,"I bought this tonight for my mom and I. I couldn’t eat it. It’s some of the worst flavored ice cream I have had. The cookie crumbs do taste like cooking crumbs, gritty and all. The caramel flavor is very light barely there. The cheesecake truffle pieces are terrible. I love cheesecake, I bake wonderful cheesecakes, I hate the no bake style of cheesecake but these truffles are worse than that. They taste like someone took ice milk and mixed a dash a cream cheese in it. I was sorely disappointed. My mom did not enjoy it either. I have not idea what I am going to do with the stuff now but I’m certainly not going to eat it."

13_bj,FuzzyGut,2019-07-03,2,Boring,10,4,"See, here is my issue: if I’m going to spend 1200 calories in one sitting on ice cream (and we all eat the whole pint) after working hard to burn enough calories to eat it, I want to melt at the first bite and feel the euphoria with every spoonful, and SO many Ben and Jerry’s flavors do that for me. But when a flavor is just ok, there is no way I’m going to eat it. There was nothing wrong really, with this flavor but I found the ice cream grainy and the flavor boring, and the truffles just didn’t do it for me. I LOVE Ben and Jerry’s, the pints are my favorite ways to spend my calories but I can’t justify eating a boring one. My wife liked it well enough but she wasn’t wowed either. I remember my first bites of Phish Food, Half Baked, one sweet world and so many others that just made me melt into a pool of euphoric joy and that’s what I need from my pints."

13_bj,ChrisColby,2018-04-14,4,The best of the truffle lineup.,3,0,"Fantastic flavor. The caramel addition to the cheesecake base makes it stand out far more than B&J's other cheesecake flavors. That flavor is made even stronger by the cheesecake truffles. The graham cracker and cookie crumbs complement each other perfectly, and the overall flavor is accurate to the real thing. Thank goodness the best cheesecake flavor is not a limited batch."

The cheesecake bits are creamy that literally melt in your mouth, the icecream is like no basic flavor that you've ever had, and the cookie bits pull it all together to ensure you never get a boring bite! My absolute FAVORITE flavor, never change Ben & Jerry's"
13_bj,Olesik,2018-10-14,5,My new favorite!,0,0,I have been buying this one every single time I get Ben and Jerrys. I have probably bought it a good 20 times. The first time i don't think I liked it because it had a weird flavor but it really grew on me. I don't think it taste like caramel or cheesecake at all I really don't know what it taste like exactly but I love the cookie swirl and those balls I love them theu don't taste like cheesecake either and can't even describe what they do taste like it's like they made a really weird but awesome flavor but put it in the wrong container. Love it though I hope they don't discontinue.
13_bj,icecreamislife15,2018-08-09,3,Review Echo - Loved all but the CheeseCake Truffel,2,0,"I am going to completely echo the review of kuroyuuki below. This ice-cream is lovely, the cookie crumbles are nice and sweet, the caramel is perfectly subtle. The Cheese Cake Truffles, however, are almost sour in contrast. Unlike most ice cream ""goodies"" that I dig for (i.e. cookie dough chunks, brownie bits), I find myself trying to spoon around the cheese cake."
13_bj,Rosey,2018-09-10,2,Cheesecake truffles taste...tastless?,2,0,"I purchased this ice cream hoping to find a replacement for Cheesecake Brownie since Ben and Jerry's is discontinuing that flavor. I am famous for finishing their pints in one sitting (I know, I am grossly unhealthy). Anyhow, I got through half the pint and had to throw the rest away. Very disappointing."
13_bj,Sali,2018-05-09,5,Amazing Ben and Jerry never fails me,2,0,"This is an ice cream I have been waiting to have I always felt I had to choose between strawberry cheesecake, American dream and cookie core, but now I have this! Rich flavor and extremely generous with cheesecake and cookie ratio. It is so smooth! This will forever be my go to ice cream and flavor"
13_bj,CatB,2018-06-25,2,Disappointing,4,1,The cheesecake bits tasted weird? Almost tasteless. The other truffle flavor is much better. I ended up throwing the rest of this pint away because I didn’t wanna waste the calories on it.
13_bj,kail,2018-06-25,3,Overall good taste,1,0,"I recently bought this flavor and was most looking forward to the graham cracker/cheesecake truffle. However, I was highly disappointed with the flavor of the truffle. The ice cream itself tastes a lot like cheesecake, but the pieces themselves do not. I’ve had the strawberry cheesecake flavor before, and those cheesecake pieces, from what I remember, tastes how I feel these pieces should as well. Not sure if I would rebuy, but I’m glad I at least tried it."
13_bj,Ash5647,2019-08-27,2,Bad tasting cheesecake truffles,2,0,"The cheesecake truffles have a horrible taste, they almost taste like plastic. I had to eat around them! Ben & Jerry’s what happened to your awful tasting cheesecake truffles, everything else was delicious!"
13_bj,VIBookworm,2019-07-05,1,Did not meet expectations,18,20,The flavor made this a must try for me. I was sorely disappointed. The cookie swirls were the only thing I could taste. The truffles had no flavor and the caramel cheesecake flavor was barely noticeable.
13_bj,onders,2018-06-14,5,a perfect iced cream flavor for any human,3,1,"scientists have tried for thousands of years to create the best flavor of ice cream. now, with Ben & Jerry's Caramel Chocolate Truffles ice cream, those scientists can sleep easy. ben or jerry should delete any review that isnt 5/5 stars or higher."
13_bj,ScarletC,2018-06-14,1,A spoonful of disappointment,2,6,"I bought this flavor like 30 minutes ago because ya girl is hungry asf and had just cried for 2 hours. I love the Salty Caramel Core to death but sadly, Publix was out. But a sad attempt to substitute my caramel craving, I bought this piece of garbage. This doesn’t even taste like caramel, cheesecake, or chocolate. It is a hot mess of a flavor and I could do without. I truly expected more and I am still craving caramel, sad to say that every spoonful brought me closer to tears from disappointment."
13_bj,isabel,2020-05-16,5,Caramel Chocolate Cheesecake Truffles,0,0,This ice cream is the best thing I’ve ever spent my money on. It is perfect in every way and each component works beautifully together. I know for a fact I will never find another ice cream better than this one. I buy a pint at least once a month(I would buy more often if the calories weren’t so high)! I often eat the whole thing at once because it’s so good. I also have a tree-nut allergy which makes it extremely difficult if not impossible to find fun ice cream flavors I can eat and this one is safe! It’s definitely a must try!!
13_bj,Raebirds,2019-01-28,1,Poor execution,3,1,This sounds more delicious than it actually is. The cheesecake bites don’t taste anything like cheesecake. I wish I could have my money back.
13_bj,Youdontneedtoknow,2018-04-08,3,Eh it’s okay,2,1,"I had to try this because I love cheesecake ice cream! The flavor of the icecream itself with the cookies is amazing! But honestly, the cheesecake bites ruined it for me. They just taste like balls of butter. They are not good at all. If those were changed this would probably be my favorite. Think about it Ben & Jerrys."
13_bj,prefrosh,2018-04-20,1,Ewwww,5,6,My absolute favorite flavor is the strawberry cheesecake so I was so excited to try the chocolate cheesecake. I was so very disappointed to find that it was really just cookies n cream ice cream with little chunks of lard covered in graham dust.
13_bj,hsa13,2018-03-06,4,Excellent flavor,1,0,"The ice cream flavor and cookie swirl is phenomenal, but the cheesecake truffles in my pint had no flavor, which was disappointing. There weren’t very many truffles in the pint, however, so I couldn’t even complain much about them."

13_bj,UncleP,2018-09-08,4,Bomb except..,2,1,This ice cream is delicious but the truffles are gross kinda...they’re very cheesy and sour in an odd way. make them less cheesy or something and add way more chocolate cookie and this ice cream will be perfect
13_bj,imjulz,2020-09-16,5,This is the first new flavor I have really liked!,0,0,"I thought this ice cream was delicious. I do see how some people wouldn't like the cheesecake bites because they are tart compared to the ice cream. The base tastes more like a rich vanilla than caramel but I found it to be very tasty. If B&J changes the cheesecake bites they will have more satisfied consumers. I'll just keep buying it until they discontinue it. With the exception of Americone Dream, Peanut Butter Cup, and Cherry Garcia every time I love a flavor they discontinue it."

Then the stores stopped carrying it for a while and now I recently noticed target has it in stock but the cheesecake pieces are no longer covered in graham cracker and the the flavor just isnt the same. This was the only flavor ice cream I would buy, and it was totally worth every calorie. Unless they change it back to their old version, I unfortunately won’t be buying it. PLEASEEEEEEE MAKE IT THE WAY IT WAS!!"

I am always up for trying the new flavors and was excited to see this one at our grocery store. I mean caramel, chocolate, and cheesecake truffles...Come On! How can you not give the nod to this one? It has become one of my favorite flavors and obviously that of others as well since the quantities are always the most limited in the freezer case. Keep up the great work with the crazy good flavors!"

The flavors are so perfect in every way and compliment eachother so well! I dont understand why Walmart & target near me stopped carrying it! I have been craving it so bad and refuse to eat anything else. I really liked cinnamon buns before trying this flavor and they dont sell that anymore either!! PLEASE BRING IT BACK!!!

13_bj,Jcforever3,2020-02-12,3,Didn't Get What I Was Expecting,0,0,"Long story short:
- cheesecake tastes weird, reminds me of some dairy free, coconut based cream cheese substitutes I've had, really needs revision
- graham cracker around the cheesecake is really good and adds good contrast in texture and flavor! wish there was more of it
- the cookie ""swirl"" I guess is a swirl because the cookie is swirled into the ice cream but its SOOOOOOOOO THIN. I was expecting a thick cookie swirl that I could pick out cookie chunks from. really disappointing because the cookies were so good!
- ice cream i guess slightly reminded me of butterscotch/caramel? if I was blindfolded and tried it I would probably think it's vanilla. it is very tasty though"
13_bj,Shann,2019-04-07,1,Cheesecake bites are bad,1,1,"I usually love Ben and Jerry's, but this ice cream was so bad that I'm writing my first ice cream review. The ice cream itself is not good, but the cheesecake bites are awful. They taste so fake and gross. I'm sad to say all of this because Ben and Jerry's is usually great, but I feel like I owe it to Ben and Jerry to tell the truth."
13_bj,Cat6,2020-01-07,5,The BEST,0,0,"After One Love stopped restocking, I didn’t think it was possible I would find another flavor to top it. But then I tried this. It is the absolute BEST flavor. Everything in it mixes perfectly together, and the cheesecake bites are melt in your mouth amazing. The only complaint I have is it’s been so hard to find anywhere near me. I’ve traveled to outside towns looking for this flavor with no luck. Please restock this is southwest Missouri!!!"
13_bj,There4IM,2019-05-09,2,"Disappointed in ""cheesecake""",0,0,"I'm just now dipping into Ben and Jerry's to find a favorite flavor. Based on the package description, I should have loved this. The caramel ice cream was a bit bland and could have been vanilla. The chocolate swirl was nice, and I would have enjoyed even more graham cracker. The ""cheesecake"" truffles were a real problem for me, tasting mostly of coconut oil. I'm going to continue my sampling, but the cheesecake flavors are out."
13_bj,Olivia Valeria,2018-06-24,5,I skip all meals for this!,1,1,"Oh my goodness, I'm so hooked on this flavor that I'd rather eat this than dinner. I'm almost glad it goes so fast at the stores near me so I don't eat it so often... The cheesecake truffles in this are delicious and the caramel is not overwhelming, it's subtle but just the perfect combination!"

My husband has bought me atleast 10 pints because I've never had a icecream I love more and now I cant find it anywhere in my town. Makes me so sad. I'm craving it and I need it back in my life. Best flavor ever Ben & Jerry's, please never take this one away & please make it more available. Gilmer Texas to be exact. This is a winner"
13_bj,Sam0505,2019-03-17,1,My least favorite flavor I have tried,1,1,The name sounded like something I would love. There was nothing chocolatey or caramelish about it. The cheesecake bites tasted like rotten milk. Not sweet at all. I definitely do not recommend this flavor.
13_bj,Limesti,2018-05-10,5,The best flavor ever!!!,1,1,So I eat a couple pints of Ben and Jerry’s per night usually and I have to say that this is probably my favorite flavor! It’s soooo cheesecakey and amazing. Please make this flavor forever :-)
13_bj,Lizy1917,2020-09-10,5,Best Ice Cream Ever,0,0,I've eaten a lot of ice cream in my time and I've never had a favorite until now. This is the best ice cream i have ever had. The cheesecake bites are actually big sized piece and there aren't too many to over power the ratio. The three flavor just mix so perfectly together. I say if you like cheesecake and caramel you better go try this delicious flavor. BEST ICE CREAM EVER!
13_bj,Stuart,2019-07-27,2,That's NOT Cheesecake!,0,0,"On the bright side, the ice cream was great. I would try other flavors with the same base."
13_bj,superpremium,2018-05-06,4,Good!,0,0,"Enjoyed this flavor. Caramel cheesecake ice cream is smooth, extremely tasty, and both flavors are prominent. The cookie swirls are just as awesome as they are in tonight dough. The truffles were good and the cheesecake flavor was good, but the truffles did not add or take away anything. I didn't deem them necessary in this particular pint, but it is still a great flavor."
13_bj,Mandy27,2020-02-07,5,Super good! Buying again!,0,0,I just got this ice cream yesterday and it’s already gone! I really enjoyed the overall flavors. Very creamy and not over powering. It didn’t give me any gas problems(lactose intolerant). The only downer about the ice cream was the little white balls of cheesecake( wish it was a little sweet) but overall super good ice cream. I think it’ll be one of my favorites!

Varied textures (although it lacks a CRUNCH but thats ok) with lightly changing flavors. Not over powering sweet, I enjoyed the cheesecake pieces and like others could use a touch more of the graham but I will no doubt get again."

Another level delicious, hope this stays around!"
13_bj,Flavour connoisseur,2020-08-16,4,Good in theory,0,0,"The cookie swirl and ice cream base is delicious, the cheesecake, like everyone else has said, is not. Frozen cheesecake barely has any flavour and let’s be honest, cheesecake isn’t that good to begin with. If the cheesecake was replaced with cookie dough and a salted caramel swirl was added this would be the best ice cream... like ever."
13_bj,NewFavNewFlav,2019-05-06,5,Omgsh! Instantly became a favorite,0,0,Purchased this flavor on a whim last night. Decided to taste it today & just like that I am a fan & will absolutely repurchase! I would like a little more cheesecake bites in the mix (because I enjoyed it so much) but I love the unique combination & how the flavors complement each other nonetheless. This one is definitely a keeper!
13_bj,Lili,2018-06-19,5,Yes. Yes. Yes.,0,0,"This new flavor is amazing. I don't buy ice cream from the grocery store often. My all time favorite has been the turtle sundae from a local place or two, and not much can top it. Occasionally I buy a B&J pint and have found a few I really like, like salted caramel core. This new flavor has possibly risen to the top of the list."
13_bj,tankdayglo,2018-07-03,2,Coconut oil overpowers,0,2,The overwhelming coconut oil flavor in the cheesecake truffles made this flavor unpleasant overall. I enjoyed the cookie swirl but the fake caramel cheesecake flavor of the base ice cream was also not great. If it had been a more simple base flavor & no coconut oil in the truffles this could have been a solid flavor.
13_bj,Cleo,2020-06-04,5,So GOOD!,0,0,I was recommended this ice cream by a friend a few weeks ago and have been obsessed with it! I'm not at all ashamed to admit I have eaten at least 4 or 5 pints since then and its my new favorite flavor. The ice cream is light and sweet and the cookie swirl adds a nice crunch. Would definitely recommend!
13_bj,Justice2087,2019-04-05,4,Needs more truffles!!!,0,0,I bought one a month ago for the second time and it was cheesecake chocolate swirl after truffle after truffle greatness. Sadly I bought some recently and could hardly find any on the ones I bought but I could deny the cheesecake flavor you guys excel at. Love it!!!
13_bj,Shaila13,2019-07-26,5,Delicious,0,0,I buy this icecream every saturday as my cheat treat i don’t crave nothing else but this icecream and its just the perfect combination of cheesecake and icecream. I try to buy other flavors they are delicious but this one is hard not to buy and enjoy.
13_bj,,2020-08-31,3,I'm Eating it Now,0,0,I'm eating it now and I haven't stopped. I do think it could taste more authentically like cheesecake AND also caramel...oh wait...I just bit into a cheesecake bite and now I do think it tastes pretty much just like cheesecake...cool...cool...
13_bj,Sk8djday,2019-07-26,5,Best ice cream ever,0,0,Bought this 3 times now. I love the chunkiness. There subtle salty almost sour of the cheesecake. And the chewiness of the larger chunky pieces. For a non peanut butter fan it is one of the only non chocolate based ice creams I like.

13_bj,Rylariaizmik,2020-05-07,3,What happened?,0,0,This used to be my Friday night guilty pleasure when it was truffles and now I feel like I've wasted $4. Why was this changed? The cheesecake pieces are too big and the flavor is different. I won't be buying it again.
13_bj,Cazz,2020-03-27,5,Favorite flavor ever,0,0,This is my absolute favorite flavor of any brand ice cream. My #1. BUT my local Walmart hasn’t had it the last few shopping trips which is really disappointing. I hope you never stop making this. My world would end.

13_bj,Jazmo,2019-03-30,5,Unbelievably addicting.,0,0,I hope they NEVER stop making this. This is all of my favorite flavors in one. Its not too sweet or too rich. I'm able to eat the whole thing and not blink an eye. I have 2 in my freezer hidden away.
13_bj,RottenHead,2019-01-24,5,This is a Kiss From God,0,0,The ice cream is so good it's ridiculous and the cookie swirl makes me emotional. The cheesecake truffles are not as good as the cheesecake in the 'Core' pint. This is a must try for all humans!
13_bj,cj1100,2019-04-19,5,Delicious!!,0,0,Love this flavor. The cheesecake bits are less creamy than expected but they are frozen so it makes sense. I love the caramel ice cream and wish there was more of the chocolate cookie!!! So good!

13_bj,Tubs,2018-05-27,5,My new favorite!,0,0,Tried this new flavor and I love it! The cheesecake flavor of the ice cream base is delicious and is so creamy! The cookie swirl adds a nice crunchy texture while the truffles are nice and soft!
13_bj,Ange18,2019-07-26,1,The worst flavor,0,0,I love cheesecake and carmel so I thought I’d love this pint of Ben and Jerry’s! The truffles were so terrible I had to throw them out. This flavor needs a lot of work. I wouldn’t buy it again.

13_bj,DannieQ,2018-08-15,3,Good ice cream!!,0,1,Just tried this ice cream!! The flavors are very good!! The only reason I didn’t give more stars is because I feel like the cheesecake pieces could have more flavor :(

13_bj,Ashmar,2018-07-24,1,Disappointed,0,0,Cheesecake truffles had no flavor. The ice cream itself tasted kind of sugar free/low fat. I love caramel and i love cheesecake but this ice cream was not good.

14_bj,Debn,2019-04-23,1,No cherries,3,11,My husband brought a pint for me last week. I always loved the cherries. At least as st 6 were in a pint. THIS PINT HAD ONLY 2. Very disappionted.
14_bj,BJLUVER,2018-10-29,5,THE BEST ICE CREAM FLAVOR OF. ALL. TIME.,51,4,"Wow. Just wow. I mean there's nothing better than this flavor. No topping it. Cherry ice cream combined with cherries and chunks of chocolate? Come on. This is the best flavor of all time. I'm not saying there aren't other delicious flavors that fill me with intense, creamy, passionate emotion, but cherry garcia is home. Cherry garcia is the dog that you cuddle up with on the couch after a long day of dragging your feet through the world. Cherry garcia is the mother that rubs your sweet lil head after the local school bully called your shoes ""dorky."" Cherry garcia is life. Such a wonderful flavor. I'm a life-long fan and I will pass this flavor on to my kids, my kids' kids, and their kids' kids. I love it."
14_bj,Mari724,2020-04-15,1,Very Disappointed!!!!!,1,8,"We bought 2 pints of Cherry Garcia yesterday at our local Frys Store in San Tan Valley, AZ. This has been my favorite flavor for more than 23 years. Unfortunately my husband and I are very disappointed. This ice cream does not taste like anything at all. The first thing we noticed was that it had no color at all, it was like eating plain cream. The only taste was the occasional piece of chocolate and a piece of cherry. I only had a quarter of the pint, the rest will go in the garbage. So Sad."
14_bj,Tiffany,2017-10-29,5,"Try it, you’ll like it!",13,0,"I’ve held off on this flavor for years. It seemed simple and less than exciting. Ben and Jerry’s is my secret soul food, so when I do it, I pick overtly decadent and rich like Phish Food. I got stuck with this when the hubby picked for me and he loves “cherry” anything. So, needless to say, I was so not happy inside to see Cherry Garcia. I even left it in time out in the freezer a whole day! I pulled it out the next day, fully expecting disappointment. Took a bite or two, and couldn’t stop! This is now my favorite ice cream of all time!! There’s a special sweet balance between the chunks of frozen cherries and giant chunks of frozen chocolate all generously dispersed in mellow vanilla. Every single bite was heaven! But don’t tell my husband! Gotta keep him on his toes!"
14_bj,Becky,2018-10-17,5,My all time favorite ice cream and flavor!,7,0,"This is my all time favorite ice cream and flavor. For many years we lived in an area that had roadside ice cream stands with homemade icecream. They were absolutely delicious and I enjoyed supporting a local shop, but even having had those flavors I still would choose Cherry Garcia over them all. It's kind of like an old friend, good for the soul.
Oh, and the new chocolate cherry Garcia is yummy too!"
14_bj,Father Darius,2017-08-30,5,"I don't like cherry, but I love Cherry Garcia.",9,0,"A co-worker bought me a pint of this a few years back. She didn't know I dislike cherry. I hate cherry soda, cherry pie, cherry ice cream, etc. But I tried it anyway, and fell in love. It's the only cherry-flavored thing I like."
14_bj,Brooks,2017-10-03,5,This is the best thing that could possibly exist.,9,0,"This product is amazing, it is the greatest ice cream flavor to touch my tongue. Anyone that thinks otherwise is wrong. Cherry Garcia is the epitome of ice cream, and that is a fact."
14_bj,sarah88,2017-12-10,5,The Best Ice Cream!,5,0,"Two years ago, this was the first Ben and Jerry's ice cream I ever had. Since then I have tried many different flavors, but this one is still my favorite by far. I get a pint of Cherry Garcia at least once a week!"
14_bj,FuzzyGut,2020-01-29,5,I love this one!,3,0,"This was the first Ben and Jerry flavor I had outside a scoop shop, in a pint at home. It’s got great cherry flavor in the ice cream itself and the cherry chunks themselves are great tasting and very plentiful. The fudge seals the deal and makes this a regular in my freezer!"
14_bj,Chewbacca,2018-05-13,5,"Just one teeny, tiny complaint...",3,1,"I've eaten this flavor for a decade or more. It's definitely my go to, but, if I could change anything about it I would change ratio of cherries to chocolate in favor of cherries by at least 8:1. If not more. Honestly I'd say leave the chocolate out period but I know there'd be war. I just can't get enough of the cherries. And sometimes I get a pint that's almost all fudge chips & no cherries. Frustrating. But it's still the best current flavor."
14_bj,Katita94,2018-05-03,5,What about THAT cherries!,2,0,"First, I'm not the greater fan of cherries, and I'm really bought this pint only for trying something new."
14_bj,NixinsNation,2019-11-01,2,Only cherries with this garcia,0,0,I’m so bummed. I love Ben and Jerry’s but this pint of Cherry Garcia- is all cherry. I literally scooped the whole pint into a bowl to make sure. I only had 1 small chocolate slice. Not happy
14_bj,zoey,2018-08-21,2,i guess i’m the only one who doesn’t like this.,2,0,maybe i had a bad batch. but the “cherry ice cream” had no cherry flavor at all. it tasted like pure milk with just chunks of cherry throughout. and then bits of fudge flakes. they just tasted like pieces off a dark chocolate bar. i guess this flavor is just not for me
14_bj,Forget It,2017-07-08,1,Disappointing,3,11,"Since the takeover of B&J, it has become increasingly difficult to find my favorite Cherry Garcia. So, very happy to find two 500ml containers at Sobeys. $5.49 each. I have opened and eaten the entire first container. NO CHERRY - NONE - NOT A SINGLE BIT OF CHERRY! And it ""ain't"" pink ice cream any more - whitish/yellowish bland tasting stuff. Why would you want to screw up the best ice cream ever?? I hope you made a good profit on these two containers because I will not be buying any in the future! SAD!"
14_bj,Vero123,2020-04-06,5,My favorite ice cream,1,0,"IBe tried multiple flavors of Ben n jerry ice cream but nothing compares to this flavor. It’s so perfect with the right ratio of the creamy vanilla ice cream, chunks of dark chocolate (which I know might make u standoffish but trust me it goes amazing together) and the amazing juicy cherries. Every time I go to my local store I grab a pint because it’s just so delicious you always need to have it near by!"
14_bj,chev,2018-07-06,5,,0,0,"It's not difficult to see why Ben & Jerry's has used this flavor in so many different products, because it is a good, safe flavor and for that reason, it gets a BUY IT rating. If you want a comforting ice cream treat and don't want to have your brain confused by having flavors coming at you from every different direction, this is a great choice for you and you will not regret it."
14_bj,skaizgay,2019-03-05,5,,0,0,Such an amazing ice cream unlike any other. The cherries in this are surprisingly fresh. I'm not usually a fan of ice cream with fruit because the fruit is usually very soft and mushy but the cherries in this are firm and fresh. The ice cream itself is very creamy and the chocolate is the perfect amount of cocoa without being too dark.
14_bj,stephaniewindermere,2019-01-03,4,,0,0,"I really like this ice cream, but I prefer the Cherry Garcia formula in the frozen yogurt option. The frozen yogurt is not on Influenster, so I couldn’t review it. This ice cream is very creamy and rich. The cherries are flavourful and juicy. This flavour of ice cream is so unique. I highly recommend this flavour and brand."
14_bj,cb777,2018-09-13,4,One Of Our All Time Favorites!,1,0,"We have been purchasing Ben &Jerry's Ice Cream for decades. Have tried many varieties, and have a few we buy regularly, but Cherry Garcia is my husband and son's all time favorite!! We purchase an average of one per week of this flavor. Over the years it's always been pretty consistant in taste and formulation, however the last few pints we purchased had much less chocolate chunks. One pint seemed to have a few chunks only on the bottom of the pint. My husband said ""WHERE ARE THE CHOCOLATE CHUNKS'??"" Happened to the chocolate""??? We think it must have been a fluke in manufactuing and we caught a bad batch as we purchased both pints in the same store. We had this problem with the lack of chocolate chunks in their Cherry Garcia slices, but untll now, never the pints. In ""fairness"" I am giving this product a high rating because this issue with the lack of chocolate chunks has only been with the last 2 pints we purchased, and overall it's a good product..."
14_bj,mrsbelleduarte,2019-02-04,5,,0,0,SO I love the Dead and I'm from the bay area & I have so many fond memories on Haight stopping at B & J's for ice cream. I usually get one scoop of CG and one scoop of Phish Food and it really feeds my body and soul. I never am without a lil personal pint of CG in my house. Its the best ice cream in the world :)
14_bj,elizabethf2,2018-06-06,4,,0,0,"These days, I can’t snuggle up on the couch with a container of Ben and Jerry’s and eat as much as I want- but I can have a scoop every once in a while, so I do - and Cherry Garcia is my guilty pleasure ice cream of choice. Just don’t let it thaw too much before re freezing, or it gets all crystallized."
14_bj,msugirl1901c,2019-03-08,5,,0,0,"This is one of my favorite flavors of Ben & Jerrys ice cream! The cherry ice cream doesnt taste too artificial and is delicious, I only wish they sold this in a half gallon versus just a pint! I will buy this over and over again without a doubt!"
14_bj,annie45,2017-07-04,4,Love it but I vote for vanilla ice cream.,3,3,"As a kid, my two favorite hand-dipped ice creams were cherry vanilla and chocolate chunk.

14_bj,DC24,2018-09-04,2,Not For Me,1,0,"Too much of a maraschino cherry flavor for my taste. I would prefer more of a fresh cherry taste. That being said, I can see how others would like it assuming an appreciation for maraschino cherries."
14_bj,Jim S,2017-06-04,5,Change back to vanilla ice cream in Cherry Garcia,3,3,"I prefer the vanilla because of the texture. The cherry ice cream is a little ""gummier"". The new Chocolate Cherry Garcia is interesting but the chocolate tends to cover up a lot of the cherry flavor. It's all still better than anything else around!"

14_bj,Nanny,2019-02-05,3,Confused,0,1,"Ordinarily, I would give Cherry Garcia 5+ stars. However, on two occasions (10+ years ago in San Francisco and today in Lewes, DE), the beautiful dark burgundy bing cherries were replaced with supersweet, bright red maraschino cherries that I usually only tolerate as singles atop my sundae whipped cream. What's going on?? I realize the ingredients label just lists “cherries,” but I'm hoping these two occasions were anomalies."

Well, I love the fatty smooth mouth feel, creamy... but the cherries... aggg! No, No, NOT Maraschino Cherries!!
As a side note, the chocolate would be better if it melted in the mouth easier."
14_bj,stephaniew588f,2018-11-09,5,,0,0,I love Ben and Jerry’s Cherry Garcia ice cream. I have had the ice cream bar and the ice cream in the bucket. It taste nice and fresh. It’s so good. It’s one of my favorite ice creams to buy. If I am at a convenient store I looks for the ice cream bar. It’s very fulfilling too. I would recommend this ice cream to anyone.
14_bj,malloriet5ea2,2018-11-08,5,,0,0,This is my favorite ice cream of all time. There’s nothing else like it! I love the little cherry pieces with vanilla ice cream and chocolate bars.

14_bj,Saddest customer,2019-03-25,1,Why the Change?!?!,0,2,What was once my favorite ice cream no longer holds that place in my heart. I loved the freshness and contrast of the vanilla ice cream with the big chunks of cherries. And the chocolate used to be real chocolate with that lovely chocolate snap. Now it’s fudge and cloying. No snap.

14_bj,ice22,2018-08-29,5,LOVE AT FIRST BITE,0,0,"I buy this ice cream pint every time i go to walmart! Its so good, especially because of the size of the chocolate flakes and cherries. I swear, every bite you take has either a cherry or chocolate piece. Not too sweet or too sweet but perfect and I don't even like cherries."

I’d seen people rave about Cherry Garcia but, as someone who does not like artificial cherry anything, I was super uninterested... but it’s so good! The cherries are delicious and the chocolate balances it out so nicely."

Now, I certainly LIKE other flavors but this one is by far the best. Not overwhelmingly sweet, just enough crunch and the cherry pieces are amazing."
14_bj,julian2,2018-10-01,5,,0,0,One word YUM. This ice cream has real chunks of cherry in it. The mix of chocolate and cherry is phenomenal. I find this ice cream to be delicious. It was the first Ben & Jerry's I ever tried. It's expensive but it's so worth the price! Get a spoon and try!!
14_bj,sophiaasmakeup,2018-09-07,5,,0,0,MY FAVORITE ICECREAM OMG I wish I had some right now! There's sooooooo many cherries in this ice cream not like other icecream that doesn't give you any cherries just chocolate I hate that lol. This is my favorite icecream forever and always it's the best
14_bj,shellyw1,2018-11-08,5,,0,0,"Ben and Jerry's produce quality ice cream and this is a favorite flavor of mine. I've always liked chocolate covered cherries and this is a frozen version! B&J's ice cream is more expensive than other brands, so I tend to purchase it when it is on sale."

14_bj,anasonthego,2019-02-02,5,,0,0,This is THE ice cream for when you have a fight with your best friend or boyfriend. Delicious and totally worth the calories. It's banana with chocolate and it tastes like heaven. This ice cream along with a feel good 90's movie is the bomb dot com.

14_bj,dorothyf98f0,2018-08-05,5,,0,0,This is my guilty pleasure. I could eat this ice cream all day. I love the flavor of the cherry with the chocolate. I get it out of the freezer and let it sit for 5-10 minutes then eat it because it softens so perfectly it just melts in your mouth.

14_bj,namastejesslynn,2019-02-04,5,,0,0,Cherry Garcia is one of the best ice creams I have ever had. I live the Ben and Jerrys brand and wish tat my local store had more flavors to try. We used to have a local ice cream parlor and when it closed I was sad to see it go.

14_bj,shelbyg2189,2018-08-01,5,,0,0,Cherries are my favourite fruit and so I've tried a lot of cherry ice creams. A lot of them fall flat. But the flavour of this combined with the consistency and size of fruit chunks is very well put together. I love this

14_bj,Heartofgold,2018-11-03,4,Almost perfect,0,0,"The fruit and chocolate combination is what makes this flavor a winner. The chocolate chunks are very large, and I would rather have a chocolate chip versus a chunk. More cherry, less chocolate chunk would be perfect."

In a fit of anger and depression I bought this as a comfort food since my usual choices of Karamel Sutra and Urban Bourbon weren't available. And wow. It seriously was so good that it took the edge off the anger and actually made me forget about my stupid health insurance issues for a good 45 minutes. It made those happy brain chemicals kick into gear better than sitting in a room full of puppies. Thank you for making an otherwise crummy day just a little bit better <3
15_bj,IceCreamMonster,2019-02-19,5,For the true coffee lovers,34,5,"Ben and Jerry, “Chillin the roast Truffles,” THATS WHAT IM TALKING ABOUT! You have been able to make a coffee flavor icecream with actual coffee flavor, and the coffee liqour truffles? are you kidding me?! Deliscious. This flavor ice cream has just bumped into my #2 containered ice cream and i don’t make these decisions lightly. Well done ben and jerry, well done. its not just about the stuff you put in the icecream, the base flavor makes it, and you hit it out of the park with chillin the roast."
15_bj,nickdemon1,2020-07-14,5,FANTASTIC AUTHENTIC COFFEE FLAVOR,9,0,"I recently bought this a week ago and have already bought 3. I was most surprised at the authenticity of the coffee flavor. The smooth and [satisfyingly] rich chocolate swirls were a perfect combination when mixed with the ice cream. The chocolate covered truffles were just an added bonus to the already delicious product. My 22 y/o girlfriend who does not enjoy drinking coffee itself ""too much"", also loves this ice cream flavor. 1000/10 (not a typo) would recommend to any coffee lover and non-coffee lover alike."
15_bj,Bennjerryfanforlofe,2019-09-28,1,The truffles are horrid in this flavor,16,5,"I was super excited to try this new flavor, I've been a big Ben & Jerry's fan for over 25 years. The cold brew coffee ice cream is actually quite tasty and the chocolate fudge swirl is fantastic. But the truffles are absolutely horrific and I'm picking them out as I eat through my pint. They taste like this very bad chemically bourbon flavored ball of nastiness. I don't even know how to describe it they certainly don't have any coffee flavor to them at all it really does taste like a fake chemically flavored alcohol additive. Disappointed and a complete waste of money."
15_bj,Lmcg91,2018-07-31,5,BEST COFFEE ICE CREAM EVER!,8,1,"I almost did not buy this flavor in my weekly shopping selection because it had “coffee” in the flavor. Don’t get me wrong, I LOVE coffee. But all the “coffee” flavor ice creams I’ve ever had are an injustice to coffee. They’re not well balanced in the flavor, it’s all the same across the brands. BUT THEN I tried this ice cream with coffee flavor and the liquor, coffee etc, whatever all is in this makes it absolutely delicious. My store is out of it - I’ve checked 3 stores! I hope it’s not gone forever!!! LOVE THIS FLAVOR!"
15_bj,Tubs123,2018-05-28,3,"Was good, but not great",18,10,"There were things I liked and some I didn't. Firstly, I really did enjoy the cold brew coffee ice cream. It wasn't very sweet and was strong of coffee flavor, which I liked. If you're a fan of sugary coffee, this probably won't be for you. The fudge swirls tasted good as well, but there wasn't enough in my opinion."
15_bj,NaeWavyGravy,2020-02-12,2,Not Impressed,4,9,"This had the usual new label on it so of course I needed to buy it. I opened and tasted it and well it has very nice flavors, however the flavors are rather lingering. I am also one that enjoys ""stuff"" in the ice cream and this was rather lacking. The swirl was ok, rather thick and sticky also has that liquor flavoring however the wafers were lacking and rather thin for the thickness of the swirl. The ice cream is Ben and Jerry's it's always good, however this flavor wasn't to my liking the flavor had kin of a grit to it. Other than that it was ice cream and I do love Ice cream!! I'd suggest a friend try it to compare it to my views...other than that not so much!"

I like Coffee Coffee, Buzz, Buzz, Buzz, but I wanted to try something new from the truffles line. Despite opening this up to a giant air bubble (picture attached), I hoped for a successful flavor. I'm not sure if I can email customer service about this air bubble as I had recently already found one- which would make it look sketchy if I emailed. However, I was very disappointed. The cold brew ice cream is bitter and has a weird aftertaste, and the truffles had a somewhat chalky texture. I would not recommend this flavor, but if you are against wasting ice cream and do not want to throw it out, try eating it with some sort of chocolate or chocolate based ice cream."
15_bj,Anonymous too,2018-08-26,1,No thank you,12,18,"I hoped this would be a replacement for my former favorite, the original coffee heath bar. NOPE! The ice cream flavor is horrible. Advertised as cold brewed. Tastes more like a pot of Dunkin that has sat on the burner all day. The rum is unpleasant and I can't even describe the ""truffles"". I probably would have been more satisfied with something generic and unoriginal. If you insist on trying to be trendy and adding booze to your ice cream, why not start with something safe and unimaginative like an Irish coffee with a local whiskey and maybe a caramel swirl."
15_bj,,2018-04-20,1,"Sorry Guys, but it is awful.",27,55,"I was very excited to see new flavors yesterday while I strolled down my favorite aisle at the supermarket. Besides my usual go to's, I grabbed a pint of ""Chillin' the Roast."""
15_bj,typical tor,2018-06-23,1,My disappointment is immeasurable/my day is ruined,12,15,"I was craving Ben and Jerry's tonight so made the journey to my closest convenience store to grab a pint. I usually opt for the trusty Tonight Dough, but was delighted to see some new flavors. This one in particular, ""Chillin' the Roast Truffles,"" immediately grabbed my attention. I'm a coffee lover/addict, and I do enjoy a good chocolate truffle. I figured this flavor would be right up my alley. BUT... I was wrong. The coffee ice cream is actually pretty good. But the truffles taste AWFUL. Instead of ""chocolate liqueur,"" the truffles taste like balls filled with a butterscotch that has been soaked in Kahlua for too long (and not in a good way). I love alcohol but these truffles are DISGUSTING. My disappointment is immeasurable and my day is ruined."

The fact that I can’t get my $5 makes it worse. I’ve tried a plethora of others flavors and was never disappointed but this is so.darn.disgusting. Take it back Benny, take it back"
15_bj,mchardy,2018-04-29,2,"I expected at least an 8, I got a 4 at best",2,2,"I really love coffee, particularly cold brew. When I saw this product, I ventured away from my typical ice cream choice of Tonight Dough, and I was downright ecstatic to try it out. Did I think that it would measure up to Tonight Dough or S'more? No. But, I did expect more than what I got. It just did not live up to the quality one would expect from a Ben and Jerry's ice cream. I would not recommend. It tastes like a weird type of coffee ice cream. The truffles are too sweet, and the 'fudge' ribbons in the product do not taste like fudge to me. They are very rich. I am sure some people might enjoy it, I however was disappointed. I came in expecting at least an 8, and left with half a pint of ice cream and a strong 4."
15_bj,Bjsup3531,2018-03-22,3,Not bad but not great,6,1,The ice cream itself is really good. Strongest coffee tasting ice cream I've had from Ben and jerry's. The truffle part is disgusting though and there isn't much of a fudge swirl. What I mean by much is nun at all basically.

There seems to be little to no hope in finding it again. But I will carry on. I will not cease to search out the good good. That’s actually why I’m on this site. I couldn’t believe it has a 3 star rating. My mama always said if you don’t have anything nice to say don’t say anything at all. It’s delicious. Strong robust flavour. Creamy good goodness and all the little tasties that they add to the mix, ya dig? Try it for yourself and let’s keep this one on the shelves."

My favorite Coffee, Coffee, Buzz, Buzz, Buzz flavor has apparently been discontinued in my neck of the woods. The only place I can actually find it is at the little Ben & Jerry's stand in our local mall. The flavor of the ice cream itself is great. I even enjoyed the swirls of fudge. The coffee liqueur was disgusting. It tarnished the whole pint of ice cream for me. I was strong and bitter, just not a pleasant taste. I tried to eat around it, but I ended up throwing the container out. Back to purchasing hand packed pints of my favorite from the local mall. Hopefully they will never stop ordering it."
15_bj,Anonymoose,2019-03-31,1,Overall disappointed,1,1,"I have 2 go to flavors when picking B&J, but craved coffee ice cream and decided to branch out. The cold brew sounded amazing, the cookie crumble is my favorite part about The Tonight Dough, and the liquor truffle sounded great considering the complemented flavors. The cold brew ice cream was left a little lacking in my opinion but was edible. The fudge and cookie crumble was really good, but I could not get over the truffle itself. It tasted too strong and overpowered everything else, which I wouldn’t mind, if it had tasted good. It was too strong, and too fake of a liquor taste. I love you B&J, your Tonight Dough and Phish Food are amazing, but the truffle just didn’t cut it for me, and the ice cream itself was lacking."
15_bj,FuzzyGut,2018-07-05,3,Not bad...,2,0,"Not bad, but the other Ben and Jerry’s coffee flavors are better, in my opinion. The ice cream was very good but the truffles were too strong for my taste, and a little strange. The chocolate swirl was also a little too intense. You can definitely taste that it’s cold brew as opposed to regular coffee and it’s impressive that B&J was able to capture that difference. No amateur ice cream makers, this group."
15_bj,SRDine,2018-03-19,1,It is not good,5,5,"I love Ben & Jerry's. I especially love the mocha and coffee flavored ice creams, so I was very excited to try Chillin' the Roast. I am sorry to report it is by far the worst B&J flavor that I've ever tried. The cold brew flavored ice cream was fine, it was not offensive and with the right add-ins it could have been a decent flavor. However, the truffles were terrible; they tasted sour and occasionally a little like blue cheese. I'm sad this was so bad, I wanted to love it."
15_bj,Chigirl312,2018-07-29,5,My new favorite!,1,0,"I had two or 3 pints of this before not being able to find it. It’s my new favorite after Coffee Heath Bar changed its ingredients and was no longer irresistible. The coffee flavor is a little different, not as sweet — and the truffles, true to their name, have a liquer flavor. Wonderful combination if you love coffee! I guess on one hand, I’m relieved not to be eating it regularly since losing weight has been easier, but I miss finding it on my grocery trips...please restock!!"
15_bj,CW784,2018-07-01,4,For espresso lovers,1,0,"I actually really loved the coffee flavor of this ice cream. My usual favorite is Coffee Coffee Buzz Buzz Buzz, but I can only ever find that in scoop shops (which I rarely patronize). The Chillin' the Roast Truffles was available at my grocery store so I pounced. It has a taste that people who enjoy dark roast coffee, plain cold brew, black coffee, or deep espressos will enjoy in my opinion. A lot of coffee ice creams just have a very mild coffee flavor you can barely detect beneath the plain sugar and cream flavor. This was true coffee and tasted excellent."

I was super stoked to crack it open tonight and dive into the creamy dream the description promised, only to be disappointed. The ice cream was grainy, the fudge was entirely overpowered by bitter cold brew, & the truffles tasted of nothing but bitter coconut--I had to stop eating and double check the flavour listing to be sure I hadn't made a mistake. This blend missed the mark, but at least there's rum in it? Hopefully b&j Wil try again at a coffee & chocolate combo, & hopefully it will be better than this."

15_bj,TinaBeana,2018-09-09,5,Delicious,1,0,"I love this flavor. I am actually currently going back and forth between the caramel chocolate cheesecake truffle, and this one. If you LOVE Coffee, you'll love this. When you hit one of the truffles, it is like an explosion of delicious coffee liqueur on your tongue-and you get a little crunch from the cookie crumble, which all fits perfectly together. It is perfect for curling up and watching the latest episode of your favorite show, or even movie night."
15_bj,Gumbyz,2018-03-07,3,Almost Perfect,2,2,"I'm a huge fan of coffee ice cream, and I've tried many different brands of coffee ice cream. When I picked up Chillin the Roast yesterday, I was amazed at first with the mocha taste. Then out of nowhere I get a huge coffee bean and it was so bitter and strong. It unbalances and overpowers The chocolate and the ice cream itself. It was really good, probably top 3 in my coffee ice cream suggestions. However I found myself avoiding the coffee bits after cringing while getting past the bitterness."

I was very excited after reading the title of this container, “Chillin’ the Roast Truffles”. Description is cold brew coffee, which I adore. I was very disappointed to find out the truffles in this container tastes like straight up coffee brandy liquor. I hate the truffles and for the first time in my life left this ice cream sitting in my freezer for a week, then ended up throwing it away. The ice cream itself was great!! It’s a no from me for the truffles."
15_bj,alayna8763,2019-01-07,4,Pretty Good,0,0,"DEFINITELY have to be a coffee lover to enjoy this! I absolutely love the flavor of the cold brew ice cream, tastes almost identical to chocolate covered espresso beans in my opinion. I think there should be just a little bit more swirl to help balance the coffee. The only thing I think I dont enjoy as much is the coffee liqueur truffles. On their own, the taste is very odd. However, if you eat them with the ice cream at the same time I think it works out. Definitely not my #1 favorite, but likely wont be the only time i have it."
15_bj,heysugar,2018-09-02,1,So disappointing!,0,2,"I bought this a couple days ago thinking that I would venture away from my beloved Chunky Monkey and Coffee Toffee Bar Crunch and given that I usually love all things Ben & Jerry's fully expected to love this. I tried it the first night, took a few bites and immediately hated it only to try it again tonight thinking maybe it was a fluke but sadly it was not. This ice cream tastes so much like leftover coffee grounds both in flavor and texture that it wasn't even edible. This is the first time I've ever thrown out a pint uneaten."

So of course, when I saw a new coffee flavor, I had to try it. However, for the first time, I was rather unsatisfied. The coffee ice cream itself was good, but, as others have said, the truffles are gross, and there is little to no chocolate swirl. This is one I'll be sure to never buy again."

I have never met a Ben and Jerry's ice cream flavor I didn't like...until now. Dont waste your money! Buy coffee coffee buzz buzz or coffee and heath or anything else instead! I couldn't even swallow the truffles they were that bad. The rum flavor is so pungent! The ice cream flavor could be passable but the texture is grainy. Definately doesn't even deserve the 1 star as I threw it in the trash.

The fudge swirls are also great and balance out the acidity of the coffee flavor, but the truffles are absolutely disgusting. I'd give it a higher rating, but there were so many truffles it was hard to get a bite without them. There's also not enough fudge swirls.

I came to your website and the reviews for the first time ever (and I've been eating Ben and Jerry's forever), just to see if maybe I missed a hazelnut ingredient coating the truffles (I hate hazelnut). Or something that didn't belong. The coffee ice cream was awesome, until (I guess) I bit into a truffle. Ugh. I actually just tossed $5 of ice cream into the trash."

They are incredibly different in every way, from color to taste to ingredients, so I wouldn't compare the two. I would like the ice cream on its own, the cold brew ice cream would be good with chocolate chips as a iced-mocha flavor concept. But with these truffles, listed as ""chocolate-cookie covered liqueur truffles"", the chocolate (which tastes just like chocolate, not sure where the cookie is), does not stay attached to the truffle inside. The liqueur truffle itself is the consistency of cookie butter, I was expecting the something harder. They definitely give a bit of a kick, which may not be what you are into. I plan on finishing the pint, but I think I have to be in the mood for it and it won't be the first thing in the fridge that I reach for."

I like the heavy coffee flavoring of the ice cream — it’s a bolder coffee flavor than previous Ben & Jerry’s offerings.

The description on front sounded great but I was slightly disappointed to find light colored ice cream when I took off the lid (I don't care for vanilla) but one bite in, I was a fan. The cold-brew coffee flavor is powerful and is even better than the flavor of ice cream in Coffee BuzzBuzzBuzz! And the fudge swirls match that flavor perfectly. But what I found did not fit well were the truffles. They added a bitter taste and I found they did not mesh well with the other flavors. I figured I could just eat around them or scoop them out. Sadly, the shells are to fragile and broke when I tried this. After 15 mins of trying to avoid their bitterness, I ended up throwing the pint away.

The texture, taste and flavor combinations are incredible. This is the first Ben & Jerry's review I've ever left, and this is the flavor that compelled me to do so!"
15_bj,SexyAngel,2018-04-29,1,Big let down,0,0,the icecream and fudge swirls taste amazing but the truffles are so revolting i litterally almost through up i would rather you guys bring back coffee coffee buzz buzz then continue this flavor as the biggest part of the icecream is the worst part... if you want to fix it get rid of the coffee liquer truffles and rreplace it with something expresso
15_bj,Mel92issa,2020-03-26,1,Horrible,0,0,"I picked this up at the grocery store the other day. I had never seen it before and the description sounded amazing. The cold brew ice cream itself is amazing, but those liquor truffles are terrible. They have this over powering salty, alcohol caramel taste to them. I tried to eat around them but I eventually just threw it away. So disappointed!"
15_bj,Squisheyraerey,2018-10-28,2,Super unexpected,0,0,"I saw this ice cream and though it both looked and sounded amazing. Although the ice cream itself is yummy coffee deliciousness, those cookie-covered chocolate chunks are god awful. Or at least just not for me. The coffee flavor is very overwhelming and not at all what i expected. I tried suffering through but i couldn't. I'm disappointed lol"
15_bj,Ice cream man,2018-02-25,3,Not bad,1,1,The coffee ice cream is ok! But the coffee liqueur bites are kinda butterscotch heavy!
15_bj,Roxielpn,2018-05-12,1,Disappointed,0,0,"I was so excited to see a coffee flavor, as it is one of my favorites. When I opened the carton, a wonderful coffee scent was released. Then the taste test. The ice cream and the fudge were fine, but the “truffles” were gross. I can’t describe the flavor, but it was very unpleasant. I doubt I’ll eat any more then the small sample I had."
15_bj,Whyyyyyy,2018-09-03,5,New Favorite Flavor!,0,0,I've always loved coffee ice cream and liqueur chocolates so for me this flavor was a huge hit. I first got it a few months back then had trouble finding it in stock again until now and was totally stoked to buy it again. Apparently it's a love it or hate it flavor so I would say try it for yourself. Don't let the haters change you B&J
15_bj,toaster389,2018-06-13,5,Coffee Ice Cream Like I've Never Had It Before,0,0,"This is an outstanding flavor that really re-imagines what can be done with coffee ice cream. I've had 3 pints already and I've only known about this flavor for a week! Some people have said the truffles taste weird, but I think they add a very unique flavor and this flavor should be kept as-is. I know I'll be buying it!"
15_bj,Runnermom,2018-05-20,5,Coffee and crunchies=Bliss,0,0,"I picked this up this morning at the grocery. It's gone. One sitting. I'm not a super-sweet eater, but I broke the rules for this. Coffee flavor, then the liqueur taste...plus some crunchy yumminess to chew on. I am tempted to run to the store and buy the rest to deep freeze for when they take it out of circulation."
15_bj,gingerbread92,2019-02-13,1,Awful alcohol taste,0,0,"I bought this because I love coffee and chocolate, but the truffles made me gag! The truffles made the ice cream INEDIBLE. I did not know there was alcohol in this flavor and wish it would have been more obviously stated on the package as I do not drink. This has seriously broken my trust with Ben & Jerry's."
15_bj,Lovelylashaee,2018-05-01,4,Pretty good,0,0,"I loved the cold brew ice cream and the chocolate cookie crust, however the coffee liqueur truffle inside the cookie crust was super sweet and I could only handle about 2 chunks. After a while I just scooped those chunks of the truffle itself out of its crust and set them aside and tasted much better."
15_bj,eli22,2019-06-04,2,Tastes fuzzy,0,0,I usually love any Ben & Jerry's but unfortunately this is a big miss - I don't know any better way to describe it than to say it tastes kind of fuzzy. I'd rather have coffee flavored ice cream than the cold brew grounds even if the flavor is stronger. And the truffles are as bad as people say. Yikes.
15_bj,Kaitlin,2018-11-21,5,A+++,0,0,Normally I can only eat a tiny amount of Ben and Jerry’s. I almost devoured this pint in one sitting. The malt flavor reminds me of the tiny malt cups with the wooden spoon that I would get from the ice cream man as a kid. Absolutely in love with this flavor. And mash mellow in there too!
15_bj,NuMystic,2018-05-27,5,Finally the return of a REAL coffee flavor to B&J!,0,1,Not since Aztec Harvest coffee has there been an ice cream flavor that has a good STRONG coffee flavor. Thank you B&J for finally fulfilling this much needed gap in the ice cream world! Only thing I'd love even more is a smooth mix-in free Espresso ice cream and I can die a happy man. :)
15_bj,CarG,2018-06-19,1,Swing and a miss,0,0,For me this flavor was a miss. The ice cream was gritty and the truffles tasted a little too boozy. I think the flavor combo could work with some adjustments but I won't be trying this one again. I'm still a Ben & Jerry's fan and will not hold one disappointing flavor against them.
15_bj,Dani16,2018-07-16,5,Definitely for true coffee lovers!,0,1,"I personally loved this new flavor. The coffee flavor is pretty strong and so are the coffee liquor truffles. I would definitely buy this ice cream flavor again. But if you’re not into that strong coffee flavor, I wouldn’t go for this one. Otherwise, definitely try it out! :)"
15_bj,Shell,2018-06-13,1,Disappointing,0,0,Generally speaking I have loved trying new flavors but this one just didn't live up to my expectations. It had an odd aftertaste and the texture just wasn't appealing. Hoping the kids are less picky and will consume the rest of the pint otherwise it is getting tossed.
15_bj,Madferitme,2018-07-27,1,Alcohol and ice cream don’t mix,0,0,"I bought this last night, seeing truffles in the title I was excited to try it. The part that I missed was the liqueur in it. Talk about gross... that may be the only time I’ve ever said that about a Ben and Jerry’s flavor... as I sit here in my Ben and Jerry’s shirt."
15_bj,KelliMarie,2018-04-11,3,"Love the Ice Cream, Hate the Truffles",0,0,"I am a BIG coffee toffee bar crunch girl, and I haven’t been able to find it in my new city so I got this when I saw it. The ice cream is pretty good (4/5) but everytime I eat a truffle I feel like I’m taking a shot- they’re SO STRONG. I would prefer a normal truffle."
15_bj,Randy662,2019-03-12,5,I fell in love with Ben and Jerry's again,0,0,"Because of this flavor, well, the title says it all. It is my new favorite and I buy multiple containers in the store whenever i see it, especially when I'm not even intending on buying ice cream that day. No stores near me sell it and I wish more stores carried it."
15_bj,ICLover,2019-10-01,1,"Very fake flavor in truffles, almost threw it away",0,0,"I bought this at my local grocery, and typically love coffee flavored treats from Ben & Jerrys, but the truffle bombs in this were just not good, the flavoring was overly artificial and almost antiseptic. Would have been better with a caramel swirl and no truffles!"
15_bj,KEicecream,2018-02-23,5,So Yummy!,1,2,This tastes like a frappuccino! It is bold in its flavor.
15_bj,Gamndalf the white,2018-04-15,4,Perfectly balanced,0,0,Really good. If you love coffee you will love this flavor. Every element of this flavor went together perfectly. the fudge swirls help balance the strong truffles. the base icecream is the winner in this pint though! best coffee flavor by far from Ben and Jerrys.
15_bj,ash613,2018-11-21,5,Excellent!,0,0,I love this flavor! It has a nice strong coffee flavor. The truffles go really well with the cold brew ice cream and the chocolate swirl adds the perfect amount of sweetness. I also love that it has little specs of coffee grounds ❤️ Perfect for any coffee lover!
15_bj,Kthree,2018-03-26,5,My new favorite,0,0,"My husband bought a pint of this and, on a whim because I don’t eat much ice cream, I tried a bit."
15_bj,Jeepin Jesse,2018-03-12,5,A replacement for the Coffee Heath bar switcharoo,0,3,Good coffee flavor and the little bites have a liquor flavor thats not overpowering. This is a good replacement for the ruined Coffee Heath bar after they removed the heath bar and substituted with some non goo garbage. Great job folks
15_bj,kibbyposh,2018-04-25,4,overall I really like it,0,0,My favorite part is the coffee ice cream. Just the right amount of bitter to compensate for the sweetness of the chocolate swirls. My only issue is the flavor of the truffles. Its too much. Too bitter. It doesn't work well with the rest of the flavors.
15_bj,Cat2655,2018-05-27,5,Coffee coffee coffee,0,1,"So. Incredibly. Good.
I don't know how those master minds did it but they captured the smell of a coffee shop. When I eat this ice cream I feel like I'm walking through a shopping mall and begin to catch the smell of coffee goodness drifting about."
15_bj,ttarrant4,2018-10-22,5,My new favorite,0,0,"I’m not even a particularly big coffee fan, but this flavor is AWESOME. I hope it sticks around. It’s easily in my top 3 all time favorites, and I think it would be a smart move to keep it given the ever-rising popularity of cold brew coffee."
15_bj,Sam10,2019-02-18,1,Sadly disappointed,0,0,"I decided to try a new flavor because the idea sounded good, but it did not meet expectations of Ben & Jerry’s! The actual coffee flavored ice cream is good, but the truffles taste gross. Was this even taste tested before distribution??"
15_bj,JavaJunkieJen,2019-03-04,5,Great authentic coffee flavor,0,0,"This is by far my favorite! I love the delicious, true coffee flavor and the truffles are to die for. As a bona fide coffee junkie, I heartily recommend this ice cream! Now if only I could get it in a larger quantity than a pint..."
15_bj,Mammakarma,2019-04-28,5,Chillin' In All The Right Ways!,0,0,"This is my new favorite. I was a huge White Russian fan and this is now my Treat Night go to.

15_bj,bjlover,2018-07-04,5,Bold & Creamy with Delicate Truffles,0,0,"Delish! Bold coffee flavor balanced with creamy texture and melt in your mouth truffles, love it! I'm in Starbucks country where us Seattleites like our coffee treats strong so this hits the spot. Pleeeease make a non-dairy version"
15_bj,Lizpaddle,2019-06-12,5,Coffee and crispy chocolate YUM,0,0,We just found the Chillin the Roast Truffles this week. The coffee flavor is rich and creamy. The chocolate cookie-covered coffee liqueur truffles are flavor packed and delicious. And swirls of fudge all through. We love it!
15_bj,Coffee1stNameIceCream2nd,2019-03-15,2,Good Idea...but execution not so much,0,0,I wanted to like this so much. If you only had the ice cream and more fudge swirl I think this would be better. Thise coffee liqueur cookie truffles ruined the ice cream. And the fudge swirl was almost non-existent in my pint.
15_bj,Cece123,2018-12-13,2,Interesting...,0,1,"The ice cream itself was okay for coffee lovers. The truffles were really yucky though, and I like coffee liqueur. Something just didn't taste right. And then the fudge swirls weren't good either! I could only have a few bites"
15_bj,Chery,2019-03-22,5,Mouth watering truffles,0,0,Excited to find this new coffee flavor. Each bite was better than the last. The truffles were an extra bonus of thick chocolate and a creamy center. So delicious I will be requesting it to be stocked in my home town market.
15_bj,Ducky,2018-05-03,1,So bad,0,0,Picjed this up when store didnt have brewed to matter. Super disapointed. Coffee flavor was okay. The rum and truffles was horrible. Rum was overpowering and super gross I had to toss this. Bring backmdublin mudslide.
15_bj,chris617,2018-06-09,5,Incredible,0,0,I don’t understand all the negative reviews regarding the truffles tasting alcoholic. It says on the label that it contains liqueur! And boy does it deliver! I mean who could say no to caffeine and alcohol in an ice cream?
15_bj,Chai,2018-08-12,5,I'm in love,0,0,As someone who drinks alot of coffee this is amazing. it's sweet enough to counter balance the cold brew but the flavors still taste the coffee. The cookie bite help make it the go to I'm having a bad day.
15_bj,JJCA,2018-06-12,1,Don’t waste your time,0,1,The coffee ice cream in this flavor is so so but the truffles have a distinctly awful flavor. I ended up trying to pick around them and then just throwing it out. Definitely would never buy this again
15_bj,Bedie,2018-05-18,1,Not good,0,0,"This is just not good. For the first time ever, I ate a few bites and threw the rest away. The coffee ice cream itself is ok, but not with the combination of other flavors in there. I'm disappointed."

15_bj,Nicole23,2019-04-05,1,Horrible,0,0,I normally love your ice cream but this was a huge disappointment. Super bitter tasting and the feeling of coffee grounds with every bite. The flavor of the truffles were extremely strong.
15_bj,lemmingade,2020-01-03,5,So Good!,0,0,"I am so sad that this is clearanced aty local grocery storeI find it really delicious, with a strong coffee liqueur flavor that is not overshadowed by the sweet richness of the chocoate."

16_bj,Justamom,2018-05-08,2,Hey Ben and Jerry where is my cookie dough?,5,1,"Always have loved your chocolate chip cookie dough ice cream, my husband knows this and came home with some. Well it takes very little to excite me these days but after a day of errands, housework, homework, dinner then getting son to bed all I kept thinking of, was that small tub of heaven in my freezer. So finally I put on some Guilty pleasure reality television snugged into my couch with my favorite blanket and my favorite ice cream only to notice that after a couple spoonfuls......NO COOKIE DOUGH! This can’t be correct NOOOOOOOOO!! First I was really doubting I was smarter than a fifth grader and now NO COOKIE DOUGH! Not the ending I needed to this day!"
16_bj,Paul,2017-10-24,1,Expensive vanilla ice cream - Where's the dough?,26,11,Mine does not look like the example photo... there was barely any cookie dough! I basically just paid over £4 for a tub of vanilla ice cream. Very disappointing.
16_bj,Chipless,2017-07-17,2,"Plenty of dough, no chips",3,7,"I've bought this a number of times. Usually there is not enough dough, lately there's been enough dough but it not's equally distributed. Lots of bites of just plain vanilla.
Maybe you should take whatever quantity of dough being used and make the balls smaller - that way the dough can be more evenly spread throughout the ice cream. Most of the dough seems to end up at the bottom on the pint. You're definitely not using the same amount of chips as in the picture. I'm okay with not getting dough in very bite, but want chips in very bite. Lately the price seems to be much cheaper than it use to be....is that the reason for less chips or dough?"
16_bj,Jason,2018-04-06,5,Favorite Since Childhood,14,2,"Ben & Jerry's Chocolate Chip Cookie Dough ice cream has been a favorite of mine since I was a kid. I always appreciated the rich vanilla ice cream and chunks of flavorful cookie dough (the dough isn't dry and flavorless like some other cookie dough ice creams). Sometimes you don't want a busy ice cream with too many extras and this is perfect. I usually go into it with the goal of only eating half the container, but always end up finishing it in one sitting. Classic, reliable, and delicious."

As you can see in the photo below....its just vanilla with cookie dough bites in it....WHY!? Im not that upset it still tastes good. I just hope it was processed right and not a recall of some sort and still put out on shelves."
16_bj,akg1,2017-10-14,1,Only 1 small dime sized piece of cookie dough,9,1,"I NEVER review anything, especially not food. But I live in Canada where this ice cream can run up to $10!! Wayyyyy more than other brands but you hope to get what you pay for. There was one small piece of cookie dough on the top, zero other pieces in the entire tub. The texture was weird and icy. I've had the same kind before and it was way better. With a brand this $$$ a consumer expects consistency. I will be switching to another brand from here on out."
16_bj,disappointed,2017-07-03,1,Disappointed...,9,0,"I just opened a pint of this last week and was disappointed in the quality of the cookie dough. Unlike a lot of the other reviewers, mine had enough of the cookie dough, but the dough tasted old and was too hard. I tried leaving it to sit out for a while to see if it had just needed to thaw a bit, but that did not do the trick."
16_bj,Sophiedxo,2017-08-28,1,So disappointed,3,0,"Ben and jerrys cookie dough has always been my favourite Ice cream, hate to admit but I can eat up to 3 tubs a week = £15 a week! My last 3 tubs have been disgusting, with an icy texture and the dough bits crumbly and biscuit like as opposed to the usual doughy texture. Will not be buying again as 3 times for this to happen is more than enough. I have the full 3 tubs in the freezer as they were completely inedible, ready to take back to the retailer to complain tomorrow but I'm guessing they are going to take it up with you guys."
16_bj,Jacqui,2018-11-10,1,Disappointing! Where is the Cookie Dough?!,11,4,"After trying B&Js for the first time (Half Baked which was absolutely DELICIOUS), I became a recent fan and had to come back and try their Cookie Dough flavour. Well, what a complete waste of money! I am well aware that B&J has always been more expensive than other ice cream brands (especially living in Australia) but have always been happy to pay more for a premium product. Little did I know, I would open my tub to discover next to no cookie dough in the whole thing! What's the point of having a couple of teeny millimeter specks? Why pay more for this product when you can get perfectly fine vanilla ice cream from a competitor at a lower cost?! My last experience with Half Baked was amazing but now I'm personally unsure whether I will repurchase a B&J product again as I don't want to repeat this experience of buyers remorse and utter disappointment."
16_bj,Kathryn6268,2017-06-09,1,Normally great but...,4,0,"I love Ben and Jerry's chocolate chip cookie dough ice cream. It helps me relax after a rough day. But, the most recent pint I bought the cookie dough was hard and brittle and dry? I don't know how to describe it but it was weird and not the norm. Even the ice cream itself had a chalkiness to it. So disappointing since it's a splurge to purchase Ben and Jerry's as a grad student on a budget."
16_bj,FuzzyGut,2018-06-21,5,Love the dough,4,0,"I love Ben & Jerry’s Cookie Dough. I just crushed yet another pint of it and yet again, I loved every spoonful of it! The ice cream is rich and delicious and the dough globs are ridiculous! So good that I eat it with a toddler spoon so I take smaller bites. My goal one day is to combine a pint of this with a pint of chocolate fudge brownie for a double half baked!!"
16_bj,sadandhungrypanda,2018-09-23,2,Cookie dough wasn't dough-y,3,0,"I rarely indulge in Ben & Jerry's, but when I do, I go for the Chocolate Chip Cookie Dough. Unfortunately, my most recent experience was less than satisfying. The pieces of dough felt like they were missing a few ingredients. Instead of having that really amazing soft, chewy, dough texture... they tasted like dough powder. It was dry and bland. Did the formula change or are you guys still having issues with manufacturing?"

I've literally tried all the other brands of Choc Cookie Dough and in the trash they went. I buy maybe 3 of these a week at least. Too hard to walk past. B and J is all that and more. Love you guys and your product! ps. there's always plenty of cookie dough, must be a factory issue. I've always had it packed full of dough and it's been a long time.."

Today I bought the Cholcoate Chip Cookie Dough and was sooooo looking forward to the promised ""Globs"" of cookie dough. Sad to say in the whole pint (yes, I planned on eating all of it) there were only 7 smallish balls of cookie dough... overall, the taste of the ice cream is great however, the experience became a game of hunt and peck rather than the enjoyment I was looking for. Next time I'll opt for Brownie Batter Core, lol."
16_bj,Clark,2019-01-15,5,Underrated,2,0,"Maybe it's not the most exciting flavor, but the contrast of the plain (but very good) vanilla ice cream and the ambrosia-like cookie dough chunks makes this flavor one of the most enjoyable to eat. You just have to beat the temptation to dig out every bite of cookie dough before you eat the rest of the ice cream! I've tried many kinds of cookie dough ice cream and this has by far the best cookie dough (and ice cream for that matter) of all of them."

I did run into a huge air pocket on the side so I didnt get ALL of the container filled, but my body is probably thankful for that. The lid can sometimes be hard to put back on. But other than those functional pieces, the flavor is amazing and this is always a solid GO-TO always!"
16_bj,CookieDoughLover,2018-06-05,1,Buy it only if you are up for a cookie dough hunt,4,2,I have purchased the Chocolate Chip Cookie Dough multiple times so don't even try to tell me it's due to a particular ''manufacturing problem''. There is barely any cookie dough in the 500 mL pint. It is a total waste of my money.
16_bj,valerieced7e,2020-07-25,4,,0,0,"Id give this flavor 3.5 stars if I could. Ben & Jerrys is usually awesome for me, a 4/5 stars typically (and Im a very tough ice cream critic) but this one just wasnt one of their better flavors. Now, this may be my fault because it is a rather stereotypical simple flavor, and I usually only get it at ice cream shops because their cookie dough and ice cream just taste better for some reason. So Im comparing this to my top favorite fresh cookie dough ice cream at ice cream shops, and to ben & Jerrys other more exciting flavors. If youre struggling to choose which brand of cookie dough ice cream you want at the store, just for the ben & Jerrys, its for sure one of the best brands for that flavor."
16_bj,smiley girl,2017-07-06,1,So disappointing!,3,0,"I was so disappointed by the chocolate chip cookie dough. There was hardly any cookie dough, the texture was gross and the ice cream was solid as a rock which made it very difficult to scoop and eat. I won't be buying that again, especially at that price!"
16_bj,junglekock,2020-09-04,1,Really yummy but lacking cookie dough,0,0,"I really enjoy this flavour of B&J but lately it's definitely been lacking cookie dough. I am essentially paying for expensive vanilla ice cream; had anyone been searching for B&J's plain vanilla ice cream but had no luck, they could just pick up a pint of B&J's cookie dough and get exactly what they wanted. As a student I'm struggling to justify continuing to purchase this ice cream regularly as it's inconsistent with the distribution of cookie dough. I hope to receive some form of compensation and I hope to see Ben and Jerry take more action in bettering and improving this product."

It has the perfect balance of vanilla ice cream,chocolate chip pieces,and chunks of choc chip cookie dough. I personally eat a pint a night, and I wouldn't know how to act if I didn't have any.

I have had the chocolate chip cookie dough ice cream in both NYC and Burlington, Vermont, and both were nothing short of amazing. Maybe I was lucky, but the cookie dough portions were generous and the vanilla ice cream added some nice contrast. :)"
16_bj,Jess88,2019-07-22,2,Bland,0,0,"This was the most expensive Chocolate Chip Cookie Dough ice cream I've purchased, but also the least flavorful. Mostly just the ice cream- very few cookie dough bites or chocolate chunks. Left me disappointed."

Overall, this is by far the best tasting cookie dough ice cream. The cookie dough is good, it's just that sometimes I have 10 cookie dough chunks and once I've had 2 pieces. I just wish there were more globs."
16_bj,Shane B,2017-12-28,3,Expected Better,2,0,"The vanilla ice cream is rich, creamy and has a strong vanilla the taste. I cant complain about the quantity of cookie dough because half the container was cookie dough. Unfortunately, the cookie dough was dry, crumbly and crunchy. I expected the cookie dough to be chewy and fresh, maybe I just got a bad batch."
16_bj,taylam2,2020-05-10,4,,0,0,"I love the cookie dough! It tastes so good. This is probably one of my least favorite Ben and Jerrys flavors though, as I find the icecream to be pretty bland."

16_bj,atik,2017-11-16,3,Nothing Memorable,2,1,"Ben and Jerry's made this flavor first, so they're well known for it. It's a not horrible flavor, it's kind of just there. My biggest complaint with this is that there isn't enough cookie dough, and I don't think it's because of some mistake in the manufacturing process. It kind of tastes like vanilla ice cream with the occasional chunk of dough. You could seriously improve this flavor if you increased the amount of cookie dough you put into these pints."

16_bj,SayWhat,2017-11-08,1,Where's the dough???,3,1,"This purchase left me very disappointed. It was as if I purchase a pint of vanilla ice cream. I didn't come across any cookie dough until after I was halfway through the container. At this point, I didn't eat any more ice cream but wasted the rest of the ice cream searching for the cookie dough. I doubt I will make this purchase again."
16_bj,louise,2017-07-14,1,where's the gobs?!,3,1,"I like many others who wrote reviews am very upset about the lack of cookie dough in this cookie dough ice cream. My pint of ice cream had 4 pieces of cookie dough max. I expected better from Ben and Jerry's. I could have paid less for a different brand and got way more. But I thought they were the best-of the best, I was wrong."
16_bj,shorty,2017-07-15,2,Allergen not listed.,2,2,"I was super excited to try Chocolate Chip Cookie Dough since it has always been my favorite. I thought Ben and Jerry's would have been excellent but I was wrong. Unfortunately, all I could taste was coconut. I looked on the ingredient list and it states coconut oil is in the product but didn't list it as an allergen on the label. I am allergic to all coconut (yes even the oil) and tree nuts and was extremely disappointed as I had to throw the rest away. No more Ben and Jerry's for me."
16_bj,WantMoreDough,2017-06-07,3,Needs more dough,1,2,"It seems like the biggest complaint for this product is too little dough, which I agree with (no, it's not a manufacturing issue, in my case). But I also think that is the issue with ALL cookie dough ice cream. Just look up ""what ice cream has the most cookie dough"" and while you'll find that Ben and Jerry's does, but it still might not be enough. Clearly there is a consumer demand for a truly loaded cookie dough ice cream. I hope Ben and Jerry's will indulge us. Unfortunately, this product isn't it."
16_bj,,2017-05-20,1,WHERE IS THE COOKIE DOUGH,2,2,I juat bought one of these for the first time..I took the first bite and no cookie dough..took another bite and then another still no cookie dough. So I turned it around and took a bite from the other side still nothing. there was not one price of cookie dough in the whole thing so I paid for Something I did not get and I'm very upset about it I have are Ben and jerseys my whole life and have never been disapointed until now
16_bj,qubie,2018-12-19,1,Would be excellent if there was cookie dough,1,0,"The first time I bought a pint of this I was over the moon with the ratio to cookie dough to ice cream to Chico chips, but as I kept purchasing I noticed there was less and less cookie dough/chocolate chips and more ice cream. This is disappointing and it’s kind of a waste of money to buy 6 dollar ice cream when you aren’t getting what you’re buying."

I started purchasing this flavor over a year ago & I’ve been addicted every since! The ONE thing I would change is having more cookie dough in each pint. I often feel like I have to buy more before finishing fully because I run out of cookie dough lol! I did try the Chocolate Chip Cookie Dough Core & plan to leave my honest opinion under its own picture!

16_bj,sarahc354,2020-07-25,4,,0,0,This ice cream is also really good! The only issue I have is that there is so much variance in the amount of cookie dough bites that sometimes there are not enough and others there are WAY too many to be a nice balance. The cookie dough pieces and vanilla ice cream are a classic pair and this ice cream is very good!
16_bj,Marquel,2017-10-17,5,"Awesome, safe for pregnancy?",2,1,"I loooove this, flavor I buy it all the time. I recently found out a friend of mine is pregnant and she stopped eating it. I’m just curious if the eggs in the dough are raw? Or is it safe for pregnant women to eat? If so I could let her know and she can eat as much as her heart desires. Thanks!"
16_bj,Jen622,2018-01-19,2,Very disappointed,2,0,"I’ve been buying Ben and Jerry ice cream off and on for years. I’m referring to the last year I have been purchasing your cookie dough ice cream. Although it never contained the amount of cookie dough consumers were led to believe it did in the advertised pictures or descriptions it still contained more and better tasting cookie dough than other brands I have tried. I was pleased a lot times in the beginning, but I still would have liked to see more cookie dough. Also with most of the cookie dough being toward the top and very little or almost none further down was another disappointing factor. I also find consistency to be all over the place."
16_bj,redbnice,2020-07-26,4,,0,0,"I really love how Ben and Jerry's always have these crazy new flavors, but this one is my all-time favorite. While the ice cream is all sweet, I like the perfect balance of salt in the cookie dough to even out the taste. Even though the price of the pint is not always right, it was good for at least three servings because I tend to only eat two scoops at a time. If you are planning for a big party, this might not be enough for obvious reasons. However, for a kick on an occasional sweet tooth, it is perfect!"

The ice cream was very chalky and had a weird after taste. Maybe an inconsistent batch? No cookie dough chunks a few chocolate bits, was very dry and brittle. The base vanilla ice cream had a chalky taste to it and as you tried to scoop it out of the pint was flaky. No ice crystals but left a powdery film on your palate."

Smooth and creamy with bite sized chunks of the raw cookie dough that you all know we grew up stealing and eating if our moms were baking cookies. Mine didn't but I learned how to as a kid so that's what I did. As a whole it's a great brand with unique flavors. Something for everyone.

16_bj,influenster_kaitlyn,2020-07-27,4,,0,0,"This was delicious. They have enough chunks of cookie dough so that there was at least one little cookie dough bite in each spoon full. Theres also a great balance of the cookie dough, chocolate chips, and ice cream so that youre able to actually taste all the ingredients. Only downfall for me is the taste of the ice cream base, it is kind of bland and think it could have more of a vanilla or cookie dough flavor."
16_bj,michaelah33,2020-07-22,5,,0,0,For starters this is my go to chocolate chip cookie dough ice cream brand because I feel as if they put the most cookie dough bites in their ice cream.

This didn't really have many pieces of cookie dough it was like 70% vanilla icecream & 30% cookie dough, therefore I would improve this product by adding more chocolate chip cookie dough.

Sleepover with your friends? Well, Ben & Jerry's is here. The ice cream is worth all the hype it receives as it doesn't disappoint. It comes in various flavours and it's definitely a highlight to anybody's day."
16_bj,turnerm110,2020-06-02,5,,0,0,This will always be my favorite Ben and Jerry's ice cream but I do love that they have so many different ice creams that you can try in pint size containers without having to commit to half gallons or larger incase you don't like the ice cream. I also like that it is local to me and the next state over has Ben and Jerry Ice Cream shops besides their factory.
16_bj,Momof21816,2018-03-20,1,Horrrrible,1,1,I'm 30 weeks pregnant and I was craving cookie dough and this is what I got and there was seriously 5 bites of cookie dough.
16_bj,alexisw46,2020-06-24,5,,0,0,"This is my favorite flavor of ice cream, and Ben and Jerrys is my favorite brand of ice cream. The boxes are great, and the ice cream parlors they have are amazing as well. Definitely recommend this, Ben and Jerrys is an awesome brand, theyre on the pricier side only because they pay their employees well. Overall an awesome company with awesome flavors."
16_bj,jsheu,2020-08-01,4,,0,0,"Ben & Jerrys is a great ice cream brand, but I personally dont like having a rich ice cream that also has a ton of mix-ins. Also, the majority of their ice cream features chocolate in some form, which is not something I enjoy in an ice cream (I know, not a popular opinion). I love cookie dough ice cream though, and Ben & Jerrys does a good job with it."
16_bj,bobbiek,2020-07-25,5,,0,0,"Ben and Jerry's Chocolate Chip Cookie Dough ice cream is incredible. It's very tasty and is full of huge chocolate chunks and mounds of gooey cookie dough clusters, so there's never a dull bite. Plus it has all natural ingredients, which is always a plus. It's perfect for an indulgence or special treat. Try some today; you'll be glad you did."
16_bj,stefanieamb,2020-06-22,5,,0,0,"The best take on an absolute classic. I would consume my bodyweight in almost anything from Ben & Jerrys. However, their chocolate chip cookie dough is on comparable from anything. It is my favorite I always find good pricing information especially at local grocery stores, or I can find a coupon online. Highly recommend Ben & Jerrys ice cream"
16_bj,kimmc1,2020-06-27,5,,0,0,"I love this ice cream! It is absolutely delicious. The cookie dough bits are amazing and it has a good balance of cookie dough vs ice cream. All in all a great ice cream. Perfect size For the quality I'd say its average price but it does appear to be on sale quite often- always a good time to stock up!
Its definitely a staple in my freezer."
16_bj,24tiab,2020-05-05,5,,0,0,"I LOVE THIS ONE. Anything Ben & Jerry's is the best quality you could ever imagine. I stock up on this especially because it's my boyfriend's favorite ice cream as well and it is perfect for a date night or as a gift. Please send me some!!! Love your stuff. I can promote on my tiktok where I have 25k followers as well. Much love, Tia"

I had my husband go out and buy me this specific flavor of Ben and Jerrys at all hours of the night to fix my babys and I craving lol. Its just so good. The big chunks of cookie dough with the smooth, creamy ice cream. You cant go wrong. I might have to go buy myself some tonight! Lol."
16_bj,rebeccac5359,2020-07-26,5,,0,0,"Ben and Jerrys Ice cream is definitely one of my top 3 favorite ice cream brands. They have an amazing variety of flavors, is locally made and never disappoints. This is one of my all time favorite flavors. I have loved since been a little kid riding home from beach and stopping to grab Ben and Jerrys on the way home! Must try!!"
16_bj,s_y_d_n_e_e_,2019-04-03,5,,0,0,"This flavor of Ben & Jerrys is really, really good! It balances perfectly between the ice cream, chocolate chips, and cookie dough. The cookie dough is soft and is perfect with the creamy ice cream. Its a little pricey, but all Ben & Jerrys is. Its never too much to keep me from buying it though! Definitely one of my favorites!"
16_bj,Cbugkrunks33,2019-02-16,1,Sadly disappointed...,0,0,My hubby night this for me as a treat this week. I love this flavor but was very disappointed in the pint I tasted. The cookie dough was there but no chocolate chips. The vanilla ice cream tasted chalky and the committee dough was chewy and grainy. Can someone fix these batches? I love Ben & Jerry's so this was a shock to me
16_bj,sashao,2020-07-24,5,,0,0,Omg this brand of coodkie dough ice cream is one of my favorites! A good amount of cookie dough chunks and just melts in your mouth. I dont get it too often because it is on the pricer side but when i treat myself this is the one i choose! I definitely recommend it! You cam usually find it at most big chain grocery stores.
16_bj,kristinh358,2020-07-25,4,,0,0,"While most B&J flavors are absolutely five star-worthy, chocolate chip cookie dough is probably my least fave of theirs. The cookie dough pieces are plentiful but are a smidgen dryer and chewier than the cookie dough in some other brands. The ice cream itself is DELISH, but I would choose other B&J flavors over this one."
16_bj,yasmine96,2019-08-09,5,THE BEST.,0,0,I just want to start by saying. To the reviews who said “nOt EnOuGh cOoKiE dOuGh” that was NOT the case for me. Hey maybe I got lucky lol. Because my pint came with MORE than enough cookie dough in it! Literally huge clumps of it in EVERY scoop! This ice cream is delicious!! Definitely craving it as I type this review :)
16_bj,gladism2,2020-05-06,5,,0,0,One of my favorite kinds of ice cream is cookie dough. I love the Ben & Jerrys ice cream more Because it has a different taste than other brands. This one I feel like it is more creamier and delicious. Also Ben & Jerrys is known to have so many crazy and yummy flavors. Definitely recommend if you havent tried This brand.
16_bj,jenniferj1d4a,2020-07-28,5,,0,0,"Of all the cookie dough ice creams, Ben & Jerrys is my absolute favorite. The ice cream is really good and it has nice big pieces of cookie dough. I have tried other brands and it has had basically just chocolate chips and called it cookie dough. I love Ben & Jerrys, I would recommend any flavor but this one is the best."
16_bj,elanar,2019-11-03,5,,0,0,"It's hard to pick a single favorite Ben & Jerry's ice cream, but if I had to this would be it. Ben & Jerry's Chocolate Chip Cookie Dough Ice Cream to me the quintessential ice cream. It is what put this brand on the map, and as far as I'm concerned no other brand has done cookie dough ice cream as well as they have."
16_bj,,2020-07-31,5,,0,0,You cant go wrong with Ben & Jerry's. I love this icecream because they are never skimpy on the mixture of icecream to add ins. You always get some in every bite. The price is a little steep for the amount of icecream compared to other brands but considering its more of an ice cream shop quality the price is fair.
16_bj,jazmines16,2020-07-29,4,,0,0,Ben and Jerrys ice cream chocolate chip cookie dough is very good. Along with all of the Ben and Jerrys Ive creams being so creamy and flavorful. The combination of cookie dough and chocolate chips is perfect! Also the chocolate chips in the ice cream arent hard which is just delightful because it melts in your mouth
16_bj,hangingoutwithlori,2020-07-29,2,,0,0,I am not a chocolate chip cookie dough ice cream lover and this is no exception. Too sickly sweet for me. However the base ice cream is good. My children (now grown) love B&J chocolate chip cookie dough ice cream so its a winner just for that alone.
16_bj,Polly,2020-05-27,1,No cookie dough,0,0,"My favourite ice-cream is the choc chip and cookie dough. I have just sat down ,looking forward to it...while watching a movie. Only to be totally disappointed to find no cookie dough and only a few choc chips. For an ice-cream that costs more than the average price to enjoy. I have to say what a waste of my money."
16_bj,,2020-02-06,4,,0,0,"This was my first introduction to Ben and Jerry's back when I was in college and it remains a favorite of mine today. In fact I had a scoop last night after dinner. There is just something about Ben and Jerry's that is superior in taste, mouth feel and whole experience that will have me always coming back for more."
16_bj,elizabethk9677,2020-06-16,5,,0,0,This ice cream is a premium brand which makes it a little more expensive than my usual brand. The Chocolate Chip Cookie Dough is one of my favourites! It has a lot of cookie dough and chocolate chips in it. If youd like to indulge in a high quality ice cream that comes in many flavours I would recommend this one.
16_bj,corriesbeautyspot,2020-07-31,5,,0,0,"Probably my favorite cookie dough ice creams Ive tried! I dont get this flavor often anymore but when I do I feel like you cant beat Ben & Jerrys flavor and their quality! Some cookie dough ice creams the cookie dough has a gummy, flavorless texture, but this one tastes amazing and has the perfect chewy texture."
16_bj,mkatlhen,2019-01-05,5,,0,0,"I swear, this is HEAVEN. Ben & Jerry’s are my favorite and I have a thing for cookies dough ice cream. I just can’t explain. I always get this, it’s the type of ice cream that won’t get you sick of it just “because it’s too sweet” it’s not that pure sugar ice cream, it’s actually soft and very tasty. I love it."
16_bj,karbuckle0,2018-09-13,5,,0,0,Dang this stuff is SO expensive for a little tiny pint of ice cream that goes so quickly... But there is NOTHING like it! Other brands don't compare and cookie dough is just one of my favorites. All of the flavors are so good! The limited time Bob Marley one with banana ice cream was the definition of KILLER!
16_bj,ashleyq13,2020-07-17,5,,0,0,"There ice cream is so bomb I definitely recommend. I get it all the time its a perfect snack, no matter the weather even if its raining!

16_bj,jenpb581,2018-10-03,4,,0,0,"Cookie dough ice cream is my favorite type. Ben and Jerry’s is delicious, with nice chunks of cookie dough. However, I do wish there were more of those delicious chunks in each pint, as you end up eating a fair amount of vanilla ice cream with chocolate chunks (which is still delicious, don’t get me wrong)."
16_bj,kimj60,2020-07-29,4,,0,0,"I like Ben & Jerrys ice cream in general, its usually my go to indulgent ice cream, and I especially love the chocolate chip cookie dough ice cream. It can be a bit pricey for the size of the tub, but you dont really need a bigger tub if youre going to eat it all at once. I would definitely recommend."
16_bj,adventureswithgail,2020-07-26,4,,0,0,I love chocolate chip cookie dough and ice cream so this combo is the best of both worlds. Ben and Jerry's makes the best ice cream around and their flavor range is out of this world! Super affordable and the flavor can't be beat! Only 4 stars cause I wish it came in a bigger size! Highly recommend!
16_bj,rosan10,2020-06-19,5,,0,0,"Perfect ice cream flavor for a romantic movie, breakup, time of the month etc... Ive ALWAYS loved Ben and Jerrys like even before I was born. Thats right my mom ate Ben and Jerrys Ice cream like it was her business the entire pregnancy then I came out and started to eat all the ice cream with her"
16_bj,laurag122,2020-07-08,4,,0,0,This is one of my favorite cookie dough ice creams on the market. I love the 16oz size because if youre splurging you eat the whole thing. If youre being mindful of portion sizes its easy to scoop 1/4 or 1/2 so you dont overdo it. The dough is a good soft quality while the ice cream is so yummy.
16_bj,juliab161,2020-06-25,5,,0,0,"My favorite I used to tell my boyfriend that the only way he could come over was if he brought this ice cream, my best friends were at my house watching a movie and he was like I dont have it I was like okay then go back home but I opened the door and had four different ones just for all of us"
16_bj,,2020-07-26,5,,0,0,"My favorite flavor from this brand! Although I do love my cookies n cream, Chocolate Chip Cookie Dough adds that perfect crunch into the ice cream but still very smooth and savory.

The cookie dough has a great texture and seems fresh."
16_bj,mearsy,2020-07-07,5,,0,0,"My favorite at home ice cream. The chunks of cookie dough are giant and the chocolate chips are big and crunchy. Paired with the creamy ice cream base, it all comes together perfectly. After learning more of the Ben and Jerrys company morals, I was even more glad to have a pint in my freezer!"
16_bj,sonache232,2020-07-28,5,,0,0,This is my favorite ice cream brand of all time. They have a big variety of flavors so everyone can find something that they like. Even though it is kind of on the pricier side I definitely think its worth it because they use the money they have to donate to different charities/organizations.
16_bj,susanhayleyfox,2020-07-28,5,,0,0,"I love classic flavors like cookie dough and Ben & Jerrys version is one of the best!

16_bj,rachell31,2020-07-23,5,,0,0,"I absolutely love this ice cream. But I also love what this company stands for moral and values wise so its double appealing to me. This flavor of ice cream is delicious, rich and filling! It is very much a selfish pleasure of mine and I truly cant think of an ice cream that I enjoy more."
16_bj,natashak,2020-06-03,3,,0,0,"This ice cream is pretty good. However there is never actually enough cookie dough, it is mostly just vanilla ice cream. So many of the other flavors are really packed with goodies so I don't understand why this doesn't have more cookie dough bits. Make the dough smaller and include more."

16_bj,vajoyce,2020-07-26,5,,0,0,"I love anything Ben & Jerrys, but Chocolate Chip Cookie Dough is one of my favorites. However, theres not a lot of cookie dough chunks in the pints. Its okay for me because I love plain vanilla ice cream. So I get some plain vanilla ice cream and also some with chunks of cookie dough!"
16_bj,hamburglar2,2020-06-24,5,,0,0,Yum. My favorite ice cream ever. I wish I didnt like it! Thank goodness this flavor is popular so it seems to always be out of stock otherwise it would be more tempting to buy lol. It is by far the best though even if it is a little expensive it is a nice treat every once in a while.
16_bj,Em Ward,2017-09-10,5,My favorite flavor!,0,1,"...I also love Half Baked, but this one will always been my classic, hometown flavor.

The first pint had so little cookie dough in it, that I assumed there was a manufacturing defect. The second pint proved to be just as disappointing. You may as well just get plain vanilla ice cream."

16_bj,taliao5,2020-05-05,5,,0,0,I love this ice cream because it has the perfect amount of all the components of this as it is on the package theres not just more cookie dough or less cookie dough and not always vanilla ice cream as a perfect amount of chocolate chip cookie dough and ice cream.
16_bj,allysonp8,2020-07-29,4,,0,0,Everyone loves a good basic cookie dough ice cream and this one is definitely a great one. My only complaint is that it can be really solid and you have to let it defrost a lot before you can really get into it. Its not the creamiest but it still tastes amazing!
16_bj,tallyv,2020-01-06,5,,0,0,"I LOVE ben and Jerrys ice cream! Its honestly my go to when Im craving ice cream, its a little bit pricey but I know its just because the ingredients are real and not fake like some other brands. The flavour and texture is always on par. I definitely recommend!"

16_bj,christiannar2,2020-07-14,5,,0,0,Ben & jerry's always makes the most addicting ice cream. I am always willing to pay the high price cause I know i'll never be disappointing. Chocolate chip cookie dough is a dream come true. Huge chunks in ever bite makes any cookie lover's dream come true.

16_bj,abi_auck,2020-05-13,5,,0,0,"This is it, folks. I have tried every other cookie dough ice cream and all fall short of Ben and Jerrys. I will say, though, make sure your pint is fresh. It makes all the difference in the taste of the cookie dough chunks. They get hard and crumbly If old."
16_bj,ryann4,2020-07-25,5,,0,0,Classic. Most people judge chocolate chip cookie dough by the cookie dough but to me it all depends on the vanilla ice cream - what good is anything if theres a poor foundation! Amazing vanilla ice cream and love that chocolate chips are too big like some.
16_bj,katelynb73f7,2019-12-06,5,,0,0,I am a huge sucker for ben and Jerrys chocolate chip cookie dough ice cream. It is so smooth and not super milky. A small pint last me a for a few days. Since is sweet i can only have a small amount at a time. It is a bit on the pricey side but so worth it

16_bj,kikim18,2020-04-29,5,,0,0,Ice cream holds a special place in my heart. Not many deserts can hit the spot like ice cream. All the flavors. This flavor is a favorite. Little sweet little salty. Just right and yes it is affordable. I always buy when im craving and it just hits right.
16_bj,jordoncoxx,2020-03-14,3,,0,0,"While Ben and Jerry's serves the best ice cream on Earth, their cookie dough would have one thinking otherwise. For some reason the cookie dough does not have too much taste and the chocolate pieces have too much flavor. The vanilla part is great though!"
16_bj,member05c731,2019-12-09,5,,0,0,Ben & Jerrys chocolate chip cookie dough ice cream is the first chocolate chip cookie dough ice cream I ever had and it is hands-down the best chocolate chip cookie dough ice cream available. I also love that it is made in a neighboring state of Vermont.

16_bj,rs426,2020-07-26,5,,0,0,This is one of my all time favorite ice creams. The base is a creamy vanilla flavor but with a toffee flavor like a real chocolate chip cookie. The chunks of cookie dough are substantial and abundant which I love. This is best cookie dough ice cream.
16_bj,emilyoc7fc,2019-03-04,5,,0,0,Ben & Jerry;s chocolate chip cookie dough ice cream is delicious. I don't normally purchase this flavor because my favorite flavor of this brand is Phish Food. The company has strong morals and I feel comfortable buying from them. Worth the calories!

16_bj,afa1,2020-07-26,5,,0,0,A classic! Can't go wrong with this flavor. Lots of cookie dough in there -- good ratio of dough to vanilla! I've had this maybe 2-3 times. Wouldn't always purchase this because it is really really sweet but as a once-in-a-while-buy I'd get it.
16_bj,ayaank,2020-06-29,5,,0,0,It's great. It's also vegan if you are dairy free. I am personally not a vegan but I still think it's their best flavor. It's also cheaper than some of the other flavor. I love eating this with cookies. Absolutely delicious. I highly recommend.

16_bj,hattie_killeen99,2020-06-23,2,,0,0,This dairy free ice cream wasnt bad but it definitely is not in my top five dairy free ice creams. It tastes a lot like greek yogurt and the cookie dough bites taste a little bit off. I most likely would not recommend this.
16_bj,lizzym15,2020-07-05,5,,0,0,"To me, its all about the toppings not the ice cream. You can put cookie dough on just about any flavor and I will eat it for the cookie dough. However this ice cream is so tasty either way but I love the cookie dough touch!"

16_bj,,2020-07-26,4,,0,0,I really like this ice cream but it seems a little bit too sweet for my taste. The chocolate seems slightly sharper than a milk chocolate but not as much as a dark chocolate. The cookie dough is soooo good though !
16_bj,daniellec192,2020-07-25,5,,0,0,Thus is a great sweet hard ice cream. Its single serve style cup allows you to grip for yourself satisfaction. Normally I eat halfway down and put in the freezer for consumption on another day I crave cookie dough.

The soft chewy brownies and the best part and three times now I have been let down. Each purchase was made several months apart, hoping the quality control issue was fixed. Nope. They were purchased and Walmart twice and Walgreens the most recent time. This was my absolute favorite ice cream flavor, but I think I’m done wasting $5 on being disappointed each time. Ben and Jerry’s, please figure this out. I saw that you commented that this happens when the ice cream melts and refreezes. You really need to contact your vendors and get this worked out."

17_bj,HappyMomCM,2019-03-13,1,Sad Pellets of Yuck,22,6,"I am so sorry to say goodbye to one of my favorite indulgences. In the past, I have made milkshakes and malts out of this ice cream because it's flavor was luscious and indulgent. Sadly, what I purchased today at my local grocery was not. Instead of yummy, chewy, chocolatey brownie bites; it contained gritty pellets of yuck. Each pellet was fairly uniform in size, and unfortunate in taste. Maybe some day I will be able to get this memory behind me and step foot into a Ben and Jerry's shop and see if their ice cream looks something like what is shown in the picture. Then again, after what I tasted today, maybe not."
17_bj,andiinnashville,2018-10-10,2,Same issue with the crumbly brownie,17,1,This is our favorite flavor and the last 3 cartons we’ve purchased have had the same issue of the brownie being crumbly and gritty. We love this flavor so we’re hoping this can get resolved soon! here’s a photo of what we’re seeing in these last 3 cartons.
17_bj,Djmomjeans,2019-04-26,1,I miss the old brownies.,54,16,"Chocolate fudge brownie is my absolute favorite! A few months ago a bought a pint and there was only one giant hunk of hard crumbly brownie in the center, I couldn't even eat it. I was disappointed but thought it was a freak thing. Since then I have tried it again from different stores, and different flavors i.e. Half baked and the chocolate fudge brownie pint slices. Again the brownies have been crumbly and chalky. And there weren't many brownie pieces in the them or any fudge swirls. I hope they change the brownies back to the way they were so I can enjoy my favorite treat again!"
17_bj,,2020-06-16,1,Only thing I wanted after having my baby,17,4,"So disappointed! I struggled with gestational diabetes and was unable to indulge in sweet treats for my whole pregnancy. When I gave birth to our sweet baby boy, I was allowed to have my Ben & Jerry's again. The store was out of half baked so my husband brought me fudge brownie. Couldn't even get through a proper bite because the brownies were just a crumbly/icy mess and the ice cream was sticky and solidified. I thought it had expired but it's good until Sept 2018! I was so upset. I'm afraid to have him go buy more pints if this is the result. I keep hearing about their new flavors but I waited 9 months for a regular pint and it was thrown in the trash-my husband couldn't even stomach it and he eats everything."
17_bj,Miss Pettinato 55,2017-08-07,5,Chocolate fudge brownie,15,5,"This ice cream is the best chocolate ice cream in the world, now I am a chocolate lover and I also love ice cream i love trying new flavors and also new restaurants. Ever since I have tryed Ben and Jerrys ice cream I never thought i would find another ice cream that would beat it, and you know what I have not found a better one... and I probably never will. I am only 25 but I have traveled ALOT. I lived in Amsterdam for 3 years and I have tasted and tryed many different chocolate ice creams all arownd Europe and nothing even comes close. I am now back in the US and I still have yet to find a better ice cream. ❤️❤️❤️ If your in a chocolatly mood and need a fix Ben and Jerrys is the ice cream for you!!!"

I’m sorry some don’t enjoy them but I just ate my second pint of this flavor and it’s become a favorite. The ice cream is rich and delicious of course, but the brownies are ridiculously good!

17_bj,Chrissy,2017-10-09,1,Chocolate Fudge Brownie,7,0,Im huge fan of Ben & Jerry's and normally Im a Phish food gal! Decided to try this Flavour as had 7 year old nephew staying and Brownies are his favourite desert also any excuse to indulge in a major choc feast! but was SO disappointed in this ice-cream ! was clumpy and brownies where so hard and dry?!!! Shame a let from all the other flavours ..boohoo.
17_bj,PatTuz,2020-04-14,1,What's happened?,1,0,"Every so often I'd buy a pint of ""CFB"" as my kids' and I refer it, and the brownies would be hard, crumbly, and tasteless....a real disappointment. I just attributed it to ""a batch that melted on the way to the supermarket"" or something. However, now, when we really need it, I bought 5 pints, and all are hard, tasteless and crumbly. I can't believe that I have to say ""bye-bye""to B&J's CFB."
17_bj,Mari,2020-05-09,1,Very Sad,1,0,"Ever since I was young, this has always been my favorite ice cream. I've always bought this ice cream and ate it as a comfort food. However, recently i've found that I can't enjoy this ice cream like I used to, because of the disgusting little chunks of hardness in the brownie bits. There's nothing more insulting than biting into a ""great baked good"" and instead having your teeth grit because of the inability to chew the extremely hard pieces in the brownie. I thought maybe it was a one time thing, so I bought another container. The second container had the exact same issue. This is truly a major let down, because this is the only store bought ice cream I've ever liked I hope they can fix this issue soon."
17_bj,Disappointed625,2019-03-13,1,Disappointing,3,2,"I have had this flavor from time to time pretty much since it was first made available, so I am familiar with the level of quality it can have. In fact, take a look at your pic compared to mine--totally different experiences as your pic represents what I am accustomed to enjoying and mine is a poor copycat version with crumbly bits of what appear to be and taste like inadequately mixed brownie pieces. Honestly, the ice cream would have been better without the add-ins. After reading other customers' experiences, I think I am going to write this one off my favorites list."
17_bj,Melanie,2019-08-26,1,I noticed you must read and fix issues????????,1,0,"My girlfriend and I got some of this ice cream all because it’s her favorite. She dug into it to find dry, gross brownies. We were like what? Went and bought another thinking the first must have frozen wrong or something. She dug into it and it as well was the same way. I love Ben and Jerry’s ice cream. I will go out of my way to get some. But now I’m rethinking this. The reviews go on and on for several years worth. If you don’t fix a problem that’s been on going, how am I sure the rest of your ice cream isn’t going to have problems like this. Sorry but I just can’t chance it."

Today I purchased it and must have bought a bad batch. The ""fudge brownie"" pieces were dry, crumbly, and tan in color-not like usual! It didn't taste like the normal batch either- I was so sad because after 2 bites I just couldn't handle it anymore. I just bought it today and it wasn't even close to the Expiration date either. Disappointed :("
17_bj,Tally,2017-08-08,2,Disappointed,8,1,The chocolate ice cream itself is very good but the last couple pints I've bought all had hard brownie bites. They're so dry they crack as soon as you bite into them.
17_bj,insiduous1,2018-04-24,5,This is my new favorite,1,0,"I normally get Half-Baked, but I was craving actual chocolate ice cream (which is kinda rare for me; I prefer vanilla), so I asked my husband to get me some and he showed up with this. Omgosh. It's better than Half-Baked! Usually I want more brownies in the HB because it always seems (to me) to be 2/3 cookie dough and 1/3 brownie. And this really hit the spot. The only problem is...I ate the whole pint in one sitting, which is, uh, not something I typically do and definitely not healthy. lol. I'll be sure to stop at least halfway through next time. :)"

I stopped getting it for a while and switched to Half baked....the brownies were hard AGAIN even in that. Now I've been forced to buy other brands but none can even compare to what once was the best ice cream known to man. Sadly not anymore."

I’ve purchased 3 pints in the last six months or so and they were absolutely delicious! Soft chewy brownie pieces and wonderful ice cream. However this time the brownies are awful. They are rock hard rectangular chunks I can barely scoop out and when eating them they are just dry, hard, and crumbly. Not worth the $5!!!! I probably won’t try again as this seems to be an ongoing issue for other customers as well. It was my favourite ice cream:("
17_bj,TayTayE,2017-08-18,2,Really disappointed :(,3,1,"I bought a pint of this ice cream from my local drug store and I just have to say how utterly dissatisfied I am on the quality of the ice cream I have been eating this brownie flavor for the past 4 years with no problem and I have always been a loyal customer of Ben & Jerry's so I'm sad to say that for the first time I am very unsatisfied hopefully you'll be able to make it up. And to pin point the problem area, the brownies were burnt and dry."
17_bj,Freddiegee,2017-09-07,3,What used to be,6,2,I have been buying this for a long time but it's not the same anymore. you guys have the best chocolate ice cream but the brownies have totally declined lately. I know you can blame retailers but that doesn't cut it anymore. it's not their fault. Take the heat yourselves and do something about it.
17_bj,mpc2000,2017-06-13,1,What happened to this ice cream?,4,3,"We bought 2 pints last night, chocolate fudge brownie and coffee toffee crunch. We haven't had any Ben and Jerry's in a few years. Chocolate fudge brownie used to be my absolute favorite. We each tried one bite and all hated it. The brownies were hard and the ice cream tasted really weird. The coffee toffee crunch wasn't much better. I guess they changed the ingredients. Doesn't taste like a premium ice cream. It's not even as good as a cheap ice cream! Definitely won't buy again!"
17_bj,Michael G,2020-09-24,1,So disapointed,0,0,This used to be heaven in a cup. Now the squishy delicious brownie has been reduced to some indescribable light colured crunchy substance that neither looks og tastes like brownie. Surpriced to see the same issue in year old reviews.
17_bj,Melba,2017-12-14,3,Totally Torn!!,3,2,"This has been my favorite flavor since it came out. However I’ve recently switched to different flavors because the consistency is very bad regarding the brownie chunks. I understand the issue regarding handling but if you cannot control the quality of your product through your vendors, well that’s concernjng for your product. I look forward to the company regulating handling so I can come back to my beloved flavor. Meanwhile, your other flavors are definitely keeping me busy!!"
17_bj,Marissak,2017-08-16,2,So disappointed,3,3,I haven't had any of these ice creams in about 8 or 9 months and to celebrate my nephews birthday I took him to get one since I don't get to see him besides every couple months. Well when we got home for his party he took a bite and immediately spit it out. So i tried it and noticed it just didn't taste the same and the brownies were either overcooked just not made correctly. It's such a shame because this was my favorite brand but I can't afford the price for it just to be thrown in the trash :(

The other half, it's hardly any brownie, or it's a whitish color in the brownie and it's crunchy (not how it normally is, which is soft) or the brownie is mushy. So, it's a basically a 50/50 shot of getting my money's worth. I love this ice cream but I'm starting to wonder why this happens?"

So disappointing when you are expecting delicious, chewy, fudgy brownie chunks. Upon reading other reviews, it seems like this is a common issue, so I don't think I'll be purchasing this flavor again."

17_bj,PhoenixRises,2019-09-03,5,Old Faithful,0,0,"This is a classic favorite! I would buy this ice cream a couple times a week from the convenience store on campus during my college days at George Mason. Whether I was stressed out or just in the mood for something delicious I would turn to old faithful. I stopped eating this flavor for awhile when all the new flavors came in, but no too long ago by husband bought me this by mistake instead of the brownie core (another fav), and I forgot how amazing this ice cream was. I started getting this again. I love brownies, and they're not stingy with the brownie bite size and that's much appreciate. This ice cream was the reason why I fell in love with B&J in the first place, so it will always have a special place in my heart."

17_bj,lily14,2017-08-31,2,Strange,3,1,"This ice cream is usually very good and chocolatey, complete with soft, scrumptious brownies. However, my last purchase of this specific flavor was very disappointing. The brownie bites were hard, grainy, and inedible. The pint has been sitting in the freezer for months, something that is unprecedented in my house Ben and Jerry's lovers."

17_bj,beach patty,2020-02-11,1,Not what it use to be!,0,0,The only ice cream I've eaten for years is the Chocolate Fudge Brownie. Was always my absolute favorite but lately the brownies are light colored and crunchy and so disgusting that I have thrown most of the last few containers out. Have you changed something? I noticed you said that it could be from improper handling and refreezing. If that was the case I think the ice cream would have ice crystals in it. For the price of over $5 I will have to reconsider brands of ice cream. I don't mind paying the price but lately it's just not worth it. I'm sooo sad.
17_bj,Madday,2017-08-24,4,Amazing chocolate!,1,3,"I LOVE!!! This ice cream. It took my husband a few yrs to even convince me to try it. Result..... pure weekly addiction. However- the last few pints we have purchased (one for him one for me) have had SUPER dried out,almost cracker like, brownie chuncks. Not at all the ice cream I've come to love and crave. Don't know if maybe a bad batch, quality control, or recipes??? Anyway, hoping the good ole amazing-ness will return. I would still tell my friends this is amazing Icecream with a proviso that it's been not stellar lately."

Until yesterday. It tasted fine until I got to the brownie part. It felt like it was dried out, hard, and even had a crunch to it. I love the Milk & Cookies flavor (so I guess I'll stick to that), but unfortunately I won't be buying this flavor again."

It was always worth the extra money even when it came to the minis. I don’t know what’s happening with the company though, the ice cream is becoming a hit or miss. Sometimes my brownies are so soft and delicious and other times they are dry and hard to chew. It’s terrible. Just last week they were doing buy 5 and get them for $3.99 each, so best believed I bought ten because what a steal.or so I thought..... Well turns out that was a mistake because I have opened three containers and they are extremely dry and hard. Hope they see all these reviews and improve its quality. because girlfriend over here wants to love the ice cream again!"

As someone whos has ate a pint a day of chocolate fudge brownie icecream from b&j for over a year now (a bit much) I was disappointed, and unable to eat them. At $6. A pint, I wasted alot of money for about 6 weeks. I had to travel out of town to get different dates.
New batches came and they have improved , however I still find the occasional stale brownie.
When the brownies are normal, the icecream is fantastic."

Mmm mm mmm...."
17_bj,MM33,2017-07-18,1,Extremely disappointing,1,0,I loved this ice cream flavor ever since middle school! Now the last time I've bought it the brownie is crusty and nasty ! It not only is disappointing after I sit down after a extremely long day go enjoy a sweet treat that use to be very delicious- and now it's just chocolate with chunks of dry crusty brownie bites !! Waste of money

The ice cream itself was good, but the brownie chunks were terrible! They tasted more like a ball of slightly cocoa mostly flour.

Freezer burn chalky crusty brownies and an all around bad flavor. I can see I'm not alone. I've tried multiple stores and it seems like there is no bias for quality! To bad it really is the best flavor in my opinion
17_bj,porter6547,2017-07-14,1,Not the same,1,0,I always get this ice cream flavor. It is my favorite. I bought it three times within the last month and each time it contiued to disappoint me. The brownies were hard and scarce and the ice cream tasted weird and of chemical odor. So disappointed because it is my favorite flavor and I was a dedicated buyer. :((((((((((((((

I literally eat the ice cream and spit out the brownies they are so bad :( I wish they would release the brownie batter ice cream again as that was a much better ice cream overall.

The brownies used to be delicious, now they are dried crumbles of tan funk. I don't buy that the poor state of said brownies is due to a freeze thaw cycle. What happened? Really??"

This used to be my favorite flavor, and I'd buy it all the time last summer, but the brownies this time were all white and crumbly and the whole experience was so gross that it was completely inedible. I wanted this ice cream so badly and it was such a let down. And now I see that this is a common problem and has been for years. Not buying again; it's not worth spending $4 a pint for this kind of risk. Buyer beware."
17_bj,Karitx,2019-03-14,1,Brownies might as well be rocks,2,1,"This used to be the best flavor they had - moist and chewy brownies. For the last 10 years, they've sucked. Every so often, you'll get a decent pint, but mostly they are inedible. I've contacted B&J a few times and they never sent what they promised, I've stopped buying this completely."

17_bj,Kbuggs,2020-03-16,5,Taking care of customers,0,0,My fiance and I are very big fans of Ben & Jerry's especially this flavor. It's something we get to share together at night when we're alone. A week ago we had an issue with his ice cream and we hate to complain but it was an issue that really freaks out my fiance. Today we received a refund and 5 free coupons for whatever we wanted. This was a shock to him and I but was very much appreciated. It nice to see how much you care about your customers. We both thank you very much and will always be a fan!! :)

17_bj,Lucy1991,2017-08-15,3,Not sure anymore!,1,0,This is my go to flavor when I get Ben and Jerry's! Normally it's very delicious and the brownies are soft! The brownies in this pint were almost white and I was cautious as to if I should eat them! I'm disappointed it wasn't like it normally is!

I've just had a pot and disappointed to find that there are no discernible brownie pieces. Then it dawned on me that I hadn't actually had any brownies in my brownie ice cream for a while. So irritated by this, that I browsed the Web for similar complaints. It seems as though I'm not the only one, and I won't be buying again!"
17_bj,BJLUVER,2017-06-15,4,A nice change of pace,0,3,"When I'm feeling frisky I'll switch up to this flavor. You have to be in brownie mood; this flavor is extremely rich. If you're looking to power through a pint, this one might hurt, but it is delicious. The consistency of the brownies is very very good. I would say B&J does the best job of figuring out how to keep their brownies gooey and soft in the freezer. If you want a brownie ice cream, this is the best one. Not my #1 flavor, but it is up there."

The place I usually purchase buy my pints was out of PBC so I decided to give this flavor a try. The flavor of milk chocolate ice cream alongside fudge brownies, tasting as if they had been made that same week, was quite satisfying. It's as if you are enjoying brownies with a cup of milk, brilliant. Thanks!"

Every now and then I decide to give it another try, and I'm always disappointed. I can't remember the last time I bought a pint of this that wasn't dried out and gross. Now sure if it's a storage issue or an ingredient issue, but it's a real problem and a waste of money. They should have stopped selling it years ago."
17_bj,paintingthesun,2017-12-18,5,YUMMMMMY!,0,3,I was craving a treat tonight and this ice cream (it doesn't really do it justice to call it just ice cream - it's more than that) was on sale at Metro. So glad I picked some up! The chocolate is a nice deep chocolate flavour and there are so many brownie pieces in it that are chewy and delicious! I thought I was going to eat the entire thing in one sitting but it's so satisfying it's going to last me a few down and out nights.
17_bj,nina90,2017-07-24,1,used to be great...,1,1,The weather recently had been very warm into the mid 90s. I decided to treat myself and picked out this flavor.

17_bj,Matthew B,2018-12-26,2,Bad couple of batches?,0,0,"Every week I treat myself to a pint of this ice cream, however, the three times I've purchased this flavor, the brownies look white/greyish, powdery, and crumble the second you scoop them. In addition, the ice cream doesn't seem as creamy anymore, but it may have been because of the brownies... I sure hope this isn't the quality I can expect from Ben and Jerry's going forward. It's the only ice cream worth consuming."

I had no idea what to expect. My spoon slid through the brownie instantly, but when I tried a mouthful, it was like half-baked batter gum! I kept chewing and chewing the same bit of brownie. Finally, I lost my appetite and put the pint back in the freezer. I won't be trying this flavor again."

The ice cream itself tastes deeply of a good quality chocolate -- not too sweet, just right. The brownies are rich and chewy, the perfect texture to contrast the creamy ice chocolate ice cream base. Ben & Jerry's Chocolate Fudge Brownie is my very favorite ice cream, bar none."

17_bj,foodlover,2019-08-12,1,It is bad.,1,1,I saw the ratings for this before so I thought I'd give it a try. I don't know if its the brownie but its a light crumbly hard texture in the ice cream. It honestly makes the ice cream nasty to eat.

The last 4 pints I bought from the store were all bad and I had to throw all of them away."

I loved this, I have purchased a couple times and each time the brownie pieces were soft and chewy. But I would buy it just for the deep, rich chocolate ice cream, so good! And no nuts in it, thank you--I am not a big fan of nuts in my ice cream"
17_bj,Ashmar,2017-08-28,5,So good!,0,2,BOGO this week at the grocery store and haven't had this flavor in forever and decided to pick it up this week and it's just SO AMAZING.

I'm not big on sweets and consitantly eat very healthy, but I have to have a couple bites every day of my Chocolate Fudge Brownie. It's the perfect balance of sweet chocolate with a touch of saltiness and smooth texture from the brownie. Yummy in every way!"
17_bj,PrinzessJasmine,2017-10-22,4,Wisdom Teeth,0,3,I just got my wisdom teeth removed and I had my mom pick up some ice cream. I was initially nervous about the brownie getting stuck in my teeth but I found that they dissolve between the roof of my mouth and my tounge. Nice rich flavor and texture. Helped soothe my sore throat after the surgery
17_bj,Ashleys,2020-05-27,3,Another brownie problem,0,0,This has been my favorite flavor since forever and now the brownies are all dry and crumbly. There aren’t many in my pint yet though with this consistency I don’t want them. The chocolate ice cream is really good but not this brownie mess. What happened!? I miss the gooey fudgy pieces!
17_bj,Nessyrae23,2017-06-02,5,Finally a chocolate ice cream for chocolate lovers,1,1,I love chocolate and I love ice cream but that doesn't mean I like chocolate ice cream. Who else hates when you open up a carton of chocolate ice cream and it's light tan and you know the flavor will be as weak as the color and you know before you take your first bite you'll be disappointed? I kind of gave up on ice cream for a long time because of that. It wasn't until I got a job at a Ben and jerrys scoop shop and saw how dark their chocolate fudge brownie ice cream is that I decided to try it. At that point I wasn't much of an ice cream eater and if wasn't called triple dark chocolate fudge I didn't want to try it and be disappointed. When I took my first bite I was really blown away by how rich and deep the flavor was. This is the way chocolate ice cream should be. It should be indulgent and intoxicating and not for the faint hearted. Then you add in the super moist and delicious brownies and it just doesn't get any better than that. Now I can't eat a lot of this. One scoop is enough bc it is so indulgent. I have to be in the mood for it. This is my go to when I've had a bad day and I need comfort. Since I tried this I have become a loyal Ben and jerrys customer. The scoop shop closed a while back which is sad because it was a cool place. But bottom line is Ben and jerrys are the only brand that makes real chocolate ice cream the way it should be made
17_bj,Steph,2017-07-14,5,Tried and true,0,0,This has been my favorite flavor since childhood. It's true that you need to be careful to get a pint at a more reputable place because if the freezer situation is iffy then hard brownies you will get. But usually it's extra decadent with chewy brownie bits in almost every bite.
17_bj,Rebel of Mars 81,2019-07-16,5,Intense Chocolate!,0,0,"If you love semi-sweet and/or dark chocolate, you will love this ice cream. Only true chocolate lovers will be able to eat more than a couple spoonfuls. The brownie bits are rather large, they should be half to a quarter their current size, but they're really yummy and chewy."

Great ice cream with moist and chewy brownie with NO NUTS... how I prefer them.
Just chocolate, fudge, chewy goodness. My new favorite when I want the BEST chocolate fix."
17_bj,Ari1,2020-03-07,1,Nasty!!!,0,0,"Tastes like I am eating a cold, raw ball of chocolate Cake Flour Dough with glass of chocolate milk with a bitter aftertaste wasted my money no brownie chunks, creaminess, or richness just a cold mess. Need to definitely fix the recipe ASAP. UGH"
17_bj,hailley564,2019-07-02,2,Dry brownies,0,0,I usually buy half baked because the brownies are really good so I decided to go straight for the source. Unfortunately the fudge brownie flavor has brownie chunks that are dry making it more of a chocolate flavor than a fudge brownie flavor.
17_bj,heatherrrrrrr,2019-04-03,2,bad brownies,0,0,"this has been my favourite flavour for a while but the recent pint I bought was different. The brownies that used to be soft are rock hard and unpleasant to chew, and don't taste good. Very disappointing, won't be buying more for a while."

17_bj,Celly,2017-06-08,5,I love it! <3,0,0,"I've bought it a few times now, and i am usally very happy about it. Cookie Dough and this one are my favorites!
I only had it one time, where the brownies weren't perfect, but i know, how hard it is to deliver ice cream perfectly."

17_bj,leahzc07,2018-09-28,5,Best flavor of any ice cream ever!,0,0,"I have never had a chocolate ice cream so rich and delicious, and the brownie chunks are the perfect texture. It's not too sweet with a hint of salt that just makes the perfect combination. This would be my last meal on Earth."
17_bj,Boys mom,2018-03-14,3,Keep getting rotten brownies,0,0,Just like so many other people are saying I keep getting containers that have the white crumbled spoiled brownie instead of the normal soft brown chewy brownie. What is the problem? How hard could this possibly be to fix
17_bj,Peterha,2020-08-24,5,OG CFB,0,0,"Chocolate fudge brownie is super legit. Actually, all the true original flavors are delicious. There is stuff in here called a classic flavor that certainly is post sale to Unilever, therefore definitely not classic."

17_bj,,2018-03-18,3,Crunchy brownies,0,0,I’ve had 2 pints now that contain crunchy and weird tasting brownies. The ice cream was purchased on 2 separate occasions. I’m disappointed that I can’t seem to get the brownies the way they are supposed to be.
17_bj,MaefromBrooklyn,2019-11-26,1,THE BROWNIE PIECES ARE ALWAYS WHITE AND CRUMBLY,0,0,please fix this. I’ve already contacted customer service about this. This is my third time buying from a completely different grocery store and I got white crumbled nasty pieces instead of brownie.... AGAIN
17_bj,kailey123,2020-06-11,4,Pretty good,0,0,I bought this icecream about 5 days ago and it’s pretty good. You do need to add more brownies though and maybe lower the size and make them smaller but add more...other then that the flavor is immaculate
17_bj,Camille,2020-06-08,5,My Favorite Ice Cream,0,0,Im so surprised to see this has such a low rating because this is the BEST ice cream I’ve had to date. The chocolate flavor is so strong and the brownie adds such a nice texture. So happy this exists.

17_bj,Amie,2017-05-22,1,Sad about the brownies,0,0,I usually buy cheaper ice creams and thought I'd treat myself to this. There was maybe 6 pieces of brownie in the first layer and bowl. The remainder had zero brownies. Very sad and disappointing.

18_bj,BabyDontGo,2018-07-02,5,Spot on...again!,4,0,"Love this! I am a lover of Ben & Jerry's, have been for as long as I can remember and while some flavors are not typically my thing, this one is awesome! With the ice cream you get a smooth, creamy and full bodied chocolate malt ice cream, combined with a beautifully whipped marshmallow fluff type swirl. The ice cream mixed with this smooth heavenly marshmallow swirl would be enough for me but the addition of the cookie crumbled covered fudge bits, its joygasmic! Everything about this is a win, I really hope that this flavor stays around for a long time. If you want a smooth, creamy, satisfying chocolate ice cream....well, this one is for you!"
18_bj,Pnw1989,2020-05-08,4,Love the truffles not the regular as much,1,0,"Didn't realize there is a Chocolate Shake it and. Chocolate Shake it Truffles. The Truffles version is hands downs better. The difference being that one has salted fudge bits and one has cookie covered truffle bits. The truffles are gooey are delicious. The fudge is dry and chewy.
Other than that I love everything else about it, malted ice cream with marshmallow is perfect combo. Not to rich and I can eat a whole pint without being sick! Haha probably not a good thing."
18_bj,eastwest,2019-04-11,5,This is my dream flavor,2,0,Where to begin. The explosive marshmallows? The creamy chocolate? The chewy truffles?
18_bj,Cree,2018-06-10,2,Disappointed,8,7,"Something has gone terribly wrong at Ben & Jerry's. After my 2nd disappointing pint from them I was really hoping for a win. This flavor was incredibly bland. You can't call something chocolate malt just because it is light brown. I could not detect any malt flavor whatsoever and could barely taste chocolate. Even then I think it may have just been the truffles. The truffles were ok and there were plenty, but even the marshmallow swirl was also bland. Sweet tasting and I liked the soft texture but none of the flavors that were supposed to be in this were! Unfortunately I forgot to use my coupon and paid for this junk."
18_bj,KirstenBuckeye,2018-03-28,3,Hoped for more marshmallow and truffles!,4,1,I am eating a pint of it right now and the ice cream is delicious. I wish the truffles weren’t as sparse though and wish there were more marshmallow swirl. I’m about halfway through the pint and can still hardly see any marshmallow.
18_bj,NaeWavyGravy,2018-09-07,2,Disappointed,1,2,I bought this a couple of days ago and to be honest that's a long time to have Ben & Jerry's in the house. This one really isn't for me. I don't like it at all. It doesn't really taste like a chocolate milkshake to me more of a chocolate malted base with a lite marshmallow swirl. The truffle could be a little smaller which would make it have more also I'd they were a darker chocolate or a richer chocolate maybe it would be better I'm not sure but this one doesn't work for me.
18_bj,Kaya,2018-07-28,2,Bland and Odd Texture,9,8,"This one missed the mark for me. I understand the texture is meant to be more like a milkshake but I expected something different and it felt grainy. The flavor was bland for me, almost no milk chocolate flavor, closer to sweet cream. Even the marshmallow swirl was nothing like the S'mores swirl, it had a very artificial texture. The truffles were pretty good, but not as much cookie crunch as I expected and there weren't many of them. Overall, I'm disappointed. I love Ben and Jerry's but this one did not live up to the label."
18_bj,bgdl26,2018-03-26,5,Loved it but needs more truffles,3,0,"I've been obsessed with Tonight Dough for years and have yet to find a new flavor that I like as much until this one! I loved it! Tastes like a chocolate milk shake, love the marsh-mellow swirl and the cookie covered truffles were amazing, I just wish there were more in my pint. It seemed like I only had 4 or 5 but clearly there should be a lot more based on the photo. Anyway, it's still amazing."
18_bj,NotAChocoholic,2019-02-16,2,Average and Boring,0,0,"This may just be my anger speaking becuase I asked for one thing for Valentine's Day: Caramel Chocolate Cheesecake truffle. And what do I get? The most average chocolate icecream you can possibly from the Ben and Jerry's section of the freezer aisle. If you're gonna spend your money on something expensive, spend it on something good and flavorful."
18_bj,Chicksluvrock,2018-03-16,3,"Good, but not great",2,0,"I was very excited to try this flavor, and although it was good, it isn’t as good as I thought it would be. The texture of the ice cream is wonderfully creamy, but I would have liked a more intense malty-chocolatey flavor....it’s pretty mild. The marshmallow swirls and truffles are tasty though....except mine could of used more truffles! Overall good but I think I’ll stick with my favorite flavor - peanut butter world!"
18_bj,Chocolover779,2018-03-23,2,Unimpressed,3,0,"Overall I wasn’t impressed with this flavor, while it is very sweet, there isn’t much chocolate flavor. I don’t care for the fudge morsels either, they’re quite dry. The marshmallow is the best part! I will go back to Chocolate Therapy for my next pint."
18_bj,Jasper02,2018-03-13,1,Will not purchase again,3,0,"Very bland ice cream and truffles. The only good thing was the marshmallow swirl, of which there was not enough. Only had about 1 tablespoon of marshmallow and 5 truffles in the whole pint."
18_bj,Ice cream man,2018-02-23,5,Yummy,5,1,Creamy smooth Malt ice cream! Need I say more? I think it’s a great idea no ice cream company ( at least in my area) sells malt ice cream so I’m happy Ben and Jerry’s came out with this!
18_bj,Carrie999,2018-02-15,5,My new favorite!,3,0,I love everything about this new flavor! I ordered it online and it arrived today. I told myself that I would just try a bit and now I can’t stop eating it!
18_bj,samanthapaige,2018-06-08,1,Underwhelmed,3,0,"I was excited to try this but it fell short. Weird texture, off taste, the truffles were not good. Disappointed! Will stick with my Half Baked from now on."
18_bj,zoey,2018-08-21,1,not worth the calories,2,0,"the chocolate ice cream was okay.... nothing to rave about, but the marshmallow swirls didn’t taste like anything. the truffles were very sparse, there were only like 5 of them in the entire pint and i wasn’t a fan of the taste or texture. this flavor pint just didn’t work for me. i usually love ben & jerrys but kinda just wanted to throw this one out while eating it."
18_bj,Hayls,2018-03-15,2,Kind of bland,3,0,The truffles were extremely bland. The ice cream & marshmallow swirl were good but it was just lacking in overall flavor & chunks
18_bj,SarahSS,2018-02-18,5,Tastes like a milkshake!,2,0,"I had to try one of the new flavors, they looked so tempting! The ice cream flavor in this is so delicious and tastes like you're drinking a malt milkshake. There's a lot of marshmallow (my favorite part) and a good amount of truffles, not TOO many but certainly not sparse. I will definitely purchase again, but only after I try the other two new ones!!"
18_bj,AllD,2018-04-22,5,This is everything I've ever wanted in icecream,1,0,I found this flavor yesterday after not buying ice-cream in a while. IT IS AMAZING. It tastes like you're eating a perfectly made milkshake. There's a little bit of some dryer flavor in the chocolate-cookie covered fudge but it levels out the entire flavor (one of the gripes I have with half baked is that it is too rich / gooey) and the marshmallow swirls tie it all together. Please never get rid of this and if you do let me know so I can stock up forever.
18_bj,Turtledark,2019-01-16,1,A whole lot of meh,1,0,"Bought this a few days ago after finally finding it again. Maybe I built the flavors up in my head but for a Ben and Jerry's flavor, this seriously lacked. I LOVE malt, marshmallow, and truffles but it was just so bland. I tasted no malt but the ice cream was really creamy. The light chocolate taste was nice. The marshmallow was pretty consistent with every other flavor that includes it. I'm a major fish food fan. The truffles were what I had been looking forward to the most. I really liked the ones in the chillin the roast flavor. The truffles in this though had NO flavor! The only chocolate hint I tasted was from the thin coating; definitely not a ""cookie crunch"". Needless to say, I was disappointed. It wasn't bad. I mean, I love ice cream! I just really wish there was a real taste. If I wanted to vanilla, I would have gotten vanilla."
18_bj,Dumb,2020-05-26,2,They changed the fudge pieces,0,0,"This used to be my all time favorite ice cream. Bought tons every time it was on sale, gobbled it down and then bought more at full price. Love love loved it. Until they changed the cookie covered fudge pieces. Apparently the new fudge pieces are salted and it destroys what this ice cream used to be about. That cookie crust was so well done and the fudge melted in your mouth. For whatever reason Ben and Jerry’s has decided to stop making a superior product. Instead they cop out and use salt to pique people’s taste buds. We don’t need more salt in our lives or diets! Bring back the original fudge pieces and make this ice cream great again! I can barely eat it since I discovered the unnecessary and “wool over our eyes” awful salted fudge mix up."
18_bj,Tomas,2019-03-26,1,No No No!,1,0,"Picked up about 10 various flavors the other day and ""Chocolate Shake It"" was by far the worst. It was awful! Kept thinking it would get better as I ate, but gave up and tossed the last half away. I'll stick with my ""Tonight Dough""."
18_bj,Laurenisawesome,2018-07-10,2,Get the Phish Food instead,1,0,"The malt ice cream flavor is good, the cookie truffles are what brings the whole ice cream down. The truffles are bitter and too big. The size keeps it frozen and hard. The marshmallow swirl is amazing though. Then again why not just have the Phish Food which I think is similar but has the caramel to make it even better."
18_bj,Breezyj,2018-07-20,5,Excellence!,0,0,"I often feel a twinge of guilt purchasing Ben & Jerry’s over our many local brands, but yet again, the thoughtful, indulgent flavor combos are a league of their own."
18_bj,KaitlynC,2018-07-06,3,50/50,1,0,"I was extremely excited when I bought this icecream, and don’t regret it, the only thing I did not like about it was the chocolate truffles. They were extremely hard, and I felt like they were unnecessary in the icream. Other than that, the icecream was great, the taste was amazing, the marshmallow was great. 50/50"
18_bj,,2019-05-02,5,Absolutely love it!,0,0,"I personally don’t like an overly strong chocolate flavor in my ice cream. I like black and white milkshakes, frozen custard, and chocolate malt because they all have a dialed down chocolate flavor. This ice cream is perfect for me, and the marshmallow is a perfect compliment. Sometimes it’s nice to have cleaner, more subtle flavors as opposed to overwhelming concoctions of bourbon pretzel cheesecake ice cream with peanut butter salted caramel brownie chunks or something equally extra. Really well done!"
18_bj,FuzzyGut,2018-08-09,5,Yes please!,2,1,"What an awesome new flavor! First off, it really does taste like a chocolate milkshake. It’s light and creamy with the marshmallow swirl and the truffles are yummy too. Good job on this new flavor, B&J! Yum!"
18_bj,Just Me,2018-06-25,1,Truffles were bitter,1,0,"My least favorite B&J flavor ever! The truffles were almost ""whiskey"" tasting, strong and bitter. I couldn't even force myself to try and eat it. First time I have ever thrown ice cream away."
18_bj,Andrew1989,2018-06-29,2,Bland,1,0,"This flavor is not very good, overall. Its just basic chocolate ice cream with a few dots of marshmellow fluff with these really mealy truffles that taste like nothing- very disappointing."
18_bj,brianaa,2018-06-10,4,good but dont like the truffles,1,0,i loved the chocolate and marshmallow. thought i found the perfect flavor but the truffles tasted off and were too heavy compared to the consistency of the rest of product.
18_bj,Teecee,2020-03-15,5,Malt Shake Dreams Come True,1,0,I love malts so this is so delicious! The truffles are good too along w/ the marshallow bits. It's my favorite B&J's flavor & I hope it never stops getting made :D
18_bj,Girly girl,2018-08-20,5,Ice cream perfection,1,0,I’m hoping this flavor doesn’t disappear because it’s the best I’ve ever tried. Love all the yummy marshmallow creme and decadent truffles!
18_bj,Icecreamfan4life,2018-04-17,2,Cool idea but wasn't quite a hit for me,1,2,Bought this pint and the cheesecake flavor a few days ago(haven't tried the other just yet). Thinking this would be something fun and different to try(even though I'm not a big chocolate ice cream fan aside from Wendy's Frosties). And have to say as I sit here eating it now. The Malt base does remind me of a Wendy's Frosty(which I enjoyed). But I honestly don't think that it pairs all that well with the marshmallow swirl or the cookie truffles(which I've gotten plenty of those and not fully sure if I like them or not. Great texture and pretty soft to munch on. But taste wise may not be my thing).
18_bj,lme2813,2020-06-20,1,Used to be delicious,0,0,We have loved this ice cream for a while and have bought many many pints. Ove the last couple of months I have bought it at different stores and we found some of these are horrible. The truffle pieces look nothing like the picture on this site or what they're supposed to look like. Unfortunately I threw them all away so I don't have one but they're little hard pieces of stale tasting chocolate bits. It ruins the ice cream and I was blaming the store thinking maybe they weren't kept frozen but I found the same thing when I purchased elsewhere. Not sure if it was a problem at the factory or if a change was made to the ice cream but wither way it ruins it and I can't keep wasting money on bad ice cream. I don't mind paying more for good quality but I'm not getting it anymore with this flavor and it's so disappointing.
18_bj,Missa,2018-08-18,5,Rich but subtle,0,0,I have had this flavor twice now and it has hit the spot each time. It's subtle but it has deep flavor. It's very much like biting into a chocolate milkshake. I could do without the marshmallow fluff but it does have a nice texture and it breaks up the heaviness of the ice cream. A lot of people are reviewing that this flavor is bland but I like it. I hope it continues to be an option for years to come because I will be buying a shameful quantity of pints.
18_bj,violet616,2018-02-13,2,Great idea!,1,2,"I love a chocolate malt and loved the idea. While I found the ice cream itself to be delightfully creamy, the truffles certainly satisfying and marshmallow cream a pleasant addition I found the overall product to leave a strange aftertaste, so much so that I tossed out the pint after one paltry serving. Disappointing, but I intend to keep trying your new and novel flavors :)"
18_bj,Isitdahfridge,2019-01-03,3,Is it the stores’ fault?,0,0,"I bought two pints of this flavor, each from a different store, and I was quite surprised. One was from a gas station, the other from a grocery store. The one from the gas station was grainy, but my guess it was just beginning to form ice crystals (maybe the door to their freezer room was slightly open). The one from the grocery store was perfectly smooth (other than the chunks)."
18_bj,Jenniferu1,2020-06-23,4,Love this!,0,0,"I bought this today and couldnt wait to try it. I can definitely taste the malt in the ice cream. With the marshmallow it reminded me of a mallo cup candy, without the coconut, from years ago but way better as I'm not a fan of coconut. I just had a few bites tonight but plan on putting some hot fudge on it to make a sunday tomorrow and I'm sure it will taste like heaven! I eat in moderation!"
18_bj,ChrisColby,2018-04-15,3,Good flavor but lacking.,0,1,"A strong malt chocolate base and the marshmallow swirl make for a good set up, but this flavor was really lacking in mix ins. The truffles in my pints were spaced too far apart and with too few in general. This flavor needed more of a bite or crunch (perhaps a second mix in, like cookie crumbs) to reach its full potential. A good flavor (thanks to the base and swirl) but certainly lacking"
18_bj,duffy,2018-08-30,5,My new favorite,0,0,"In the past month I have bought a pint of this flavor every week. The texture is different to other flavors, more like a milkshake, which to me gives it some novelty and frankly I really like it. The chocolate cookie pieces alone are a little dry but pack great flavor and with the marshmallow swirls which are more liquid and the new texture it works together to make a truly great pint."
18_bj,SusanHop,2018-08-03,5,Fabulously delicious!,0,0,"I'm not a fan of marshmallow, but the chocolate malted milkshake ice cream, plus the truffle sold me on trying it. The awesomeness of the marshmallow was a wonderful surprise! The ice cream its self is perfect, though a bit more malt wouldn't go amiss in my opinion :-). The truffles are divine and blend the three ingredients into a satisfying and delicious ice cream experience."
18_bj,Joelle,2019-10-14,3,meh,0,0,"The ice cream itself is so good--malty chocolate, perfect. The marshmellow swirl is good and in good ratio but those fudge clusters! They're kind of bitter and just not what I was hoping for. The whole experience ends up being pretty one-note without a fun texture element. This one is so close to great, but unfortunately just not."
18_bj,Kaylazies,2018-07-12,5,Best flavor on EARTH,0,0,"Literally my new absolute FAVORITE icecream ever. It’s PERFECT. It’s all my favorite flavors together all in one and that chocolate cookie swirl is to die for and omg that graham cracker is just heaven, not too chocolately and that marshmallow icecream just ties it aallllll together. Amazing. Exquisite. Must have with every meal."
18_bj,Goldberry7,2018-10-07,2,"Palatable, but awfully bland",0,0,"I agree with other folks remarking on the blandness. There weren't many truffles, but that was actually a good thing since they were tasteless and ruined the bite on my spoon. Since my nightly bowl of B and J's is my only form of pleasure being 8 months pregnant, I felt the need to write a review. Going back to Chocolate Therapy."
18_bj,Brinkley28,2019-09-18,1,Save your money!,0,0,"I bought this ice cream from Safeway in Pasadena, MD. I was excited to try it since it was a chocolate ice cream base but man was I wrong. This ice ream had such an odd texture and tasted like ice milk. Like they just added chocolate syrup and like it get freezer brunt, I do not recommend this flavor to anyone!"
18_bj,Sarahmuffin37,2019-08-22,5,So much marshmallow,0,0,"At first I wasn't excited to try this flavor but as I love anything marshmallow, I tried it. The marshmallow swirl is out of this world! Usually it says marshmallow but you can barely taste it, this product has a good amount of marshmallow that tastes like marshmallow! I would HIGHLY recommend this product!"
18_bj,y2flu,2018-05-02,5,Surprisingly awesome,0,0,"I'm not a big fan of chocolate ice creams, but I was looking for a new flavor to try and this was the only one they had, so I bought a pint. Wow, is it good! I love the truffles and the marshmallow is awesome. I've bought 3 or 4 more pints since buying the first one, and I'm about to go buy another one."
18_bj,Mewples,2018-09-21,5,My new favorite flavor!,0,0,Whenever I'm craving ice cream this is the first thing I search for now. Others must have the same idea because half of the time its completely sold out at my grocery store! I love that the ice cream itself isnt too sweet which makes the marshmallow a perfect compliment. Please keep this flavor around ~
18_bj,Beeb,2020-04-11,1,New changes not welcome,0,0,I have been eating this flavor and only this flavor since it's release. It was everything I ever wanted in ice cream. This ice cream really needed the crunch from the truffle. And the salt with marshmallow? Ew. It needs the dark chocolate to go with that sugary sweet. So disappointed in the changes.
18_bj,Nicole8,2020-04-18,1,TERRIBLE FLAVOR,0,0,"Upon hearing the name of the flavor, I could not wait to try it!
WHAT A HUGE LET DOWN!!!
It was practically tasteless. The ice cream literally has no taste.
I love Ben and Jerry's ice cream but this truly missed the mark for me. Ill stick to my favorites Americone Dream and Vanilla Caramel Fudge"
18_bj,,2019-02-27,5,New favorite,0,0,I bought this because I love malted ice cream and I’m so glad I did. It’s delicious on its own but the addition of the marshmallow swirl and fudge covered cookie crumble really cemented it’s place in my heart. 10/10 Was thinking about a second bowl before I finished the first haha!
18_bj,Azsedo,2018-04-22,2,Dirt,1,2,"I’m eating it right now and it tastes pretty much like a chocolate, dirt, and grass blend."
18_bj,molly_yum,2018-05-15,5,My New Favorite!!,0,0,"I bought this flavor on a whim, since my grocery store only had this flavor and another I don't like when I went. OMG, it is my new favorite. So unique and delicious. I just wish there were more yummy truffles!!! I will be buying this regularly now. YUM!!!!!"
18_bj,sam347,2018-06-20,3,great flavor,0,0,im so confused i dont think i have a single truffle in mine? i came on here to see if that happened to anyone else and people are saying they are sparse. i've eaten about 1/4th and have not run into a single truffle. good ice cream but that is disappointing
18_bj,Etotheparpar,2019-06-24,5,BEST ICE CREAM I'VE EVER HAD,0,0,"I slightly consider myself to be an ice cream enthusiast, and Ben & Jerry's almost always puts out great products. BUT CHOCOLATE SHAKE IT IS ON ANOTHER LEVEL! It is so amazing, especially the truffles. Waiting for it to be restocked at my local Safeway!!!"
18_bj,LaceLu88,2018-09-06,5,Marshmallow Cream yes please!,0,0,I was pleasantly surprised to find this flavor tonight in my grocery store and had to try. I was not disappointed! All flavors with your marshmallow cream are good but this one is AMAZING! And this is from an Phish Food addict! I will be back for more!
18_bj,TaylorK,2018-09-06,1,Very disappointing,0,0,This was totally lacking in flavor. Was expecting more of a malt flavor and all i got was a watered down chocolate. It was just really disappointing for me and did not live up to what the package promised. I didn't even bother finishing the container.
18_bj,LARob,2019-04-07,5,Awesome!!!,0,0,"This ice cream is delicious! Tons of marshmellow fluff and chocolate fudge bits and creamy smooth chocolate malt ice cream, what is not to like, my god it is heaven! Anyone disappointed with this...all I can say is you must be a hard person to please!"
18_bj,TxGalNFL,2019-10-09,5,Malty goodness,0,0,I love chocolate malts. Summers drinking a chocolate malt with my grandmother under the shade of the pecan tree come to mind. Add in a swirl of marshmallow and some chunks of truffles (not cookies therefore not crunchy) make this a top fav for me.
18_bj,Willow,2019-09-29,5,Best ice cream ever,0,0,Bought it because I'm always looking for a chocolate ice cream with marshmallow and no nuts. This is what I have been searching years for! Went back and bought all they had and now I can't find it anymore so came to his site to try and find it.
18_bj,BSmith,2018-06-21,5,Amazing flavor,0,0,"Other than the all too limited edition Chocolate Cherry Garcia, (an even better version of my all time favorite B&J’s flavor), Chocolate Shake It is the best new flavor released in a very long time. Everything about it is absolutely delicious."
18_bj,Alex19,2019-02-22,3,"Great ice cream flavor, not so great truffles",0,0,"The malt chocolate shake ice cream flavor is amazing, especially with the marshmallow. However, the truffles taste like artificial and fake chocolate. I was really disappointed by the truffle flavor, but the overall ice cream was good."
18_bj,Lindsay222,2020-08-11,5,What a great idea!!!,0,0,This is my most favorite ice cream flavor ever. I would eat it almost every day if the Target stores in my area would stock more of it. It’s so delicious. The malty chocolate with the marshmallow and fudge pieces is the best creation
18_bj,Lil__Eats,2020-05-06,5,One of my favorites... ever.,0,0,This is for the ones who love a mild chocolate flavor. It reminds me of drinking Chocolate Egg Cream. I absolutely love this flavor and could eat it without all the marshmallow and chunks (but they just make it all the more better).
18_bj,misskitty,2019-05-21,5,Love at first spoonful!,0,0,This flavor was automatically bumped into my top three fave Ben & Jerry flavors. The ice cream really tastes like a chocolate malt milk shake! The marshmallow and truffles only amp up the experience. You must try this flavor!
18_bj,Shakes,2018-05-02,5,Very impressed,0,1,"My favorite is boom chocolata. Although it's tough to pick a favorite. ""Chocolate shake it"" is right up there. Amazing flavors, texture, and just the right amount of marshmallow and truffles. Very impressed with this one."

18_bj,jessicasayles,2019-04-26,5,My all time favorite!,0,0,For me this is just a perfectly balanced ice cream. It's not too sweet and a great mix of flavors. I love it so much I came to write this review. I'm pregnant with my second child now and I crave this flavor all the same!

18_bj,MBrez,2020-09-10,4,"Good, but the Truffles version was GREAT",0,0,"This is good, especially the malt milk chocolate and marshmallow swirls. But it was soooo much better with the chocolate truffles instead of sea salt caramel. Please go back to the non-caramel version!"
18_bj,Rachelcan719,2020-06-25,5,Classic Malt Flavor,0,0,This ice cream changed my life and I can NEVER find it anymore. It tastes just like a classic malt when Dairy Queen and Sonic just don’t get it right. The marshmallow swirl makes it phenomenal as well.
18_bj,Meeegsies,2020-06-29,5,Soooo delicious!,0,0,"Admittedly, I'm not usually a fan of chocolate ice cream, but this was milky enough, and I loved it. My kids loved it too, and ever since we had our first pint, we've been trying to get another one."
18_bj,Maddy V,2019-02-13,5,Amazing!,0,0,"Bought this on sale because it looked yummy, and it's absolutely amazing! I don't buy a lot of ice cream, but I would definitively get this in the future and keep an eye out if I go to a B&J store."

18_bj,MadMaxi,2018-03-24,5,Best one since Cannoli,0,0,Please keep this flavor. I was so upset when you guys only did a limited batch of Cannoli. Such a tease. While Chocotherapy was my favorite since Cannoli...now this one tops all of them by far

19_bj,Marky Mark,2019-09-01,5,The best chocolate ice cream ever,8,0,"This is the flavor that won my heart by Ben and Jerry's. If you are some one who loves chocolate and/or chocolate ice cream then you need to try this because this one does not disappoint. You will want to be multiple pints because one pint just won't be enough. I could easily eat pints and pints of this deliciousness in a single day and I am not exaggerating. It really is the best chocolate ice cream I have ever had. They could have aptly named this one Brownie Batter because it really tastes like frozen a brownie. This is for all of us chocoholics out there. Thank you, Ben and Jerry's and please never discontinue this flavor! You have shown the rest that you are the best when you created this flavor."
19_bj,FuzzyGut,2018-08-12,5,So insanely good it’s stupid,18,0,"Oh my god! If you love chocolate this is your ice cream and if you need a chocolate fix, this is your ice cream and if you’re not sure if you love chocolate this will be the ice cream to ensure you do! Up there with Chocolate Fudge Brownie and phish food, this is a new favorite of mine. So silly good I could eat 2 or 3 pints in one sitting. Please do not retire this one anytime soon and if you do, please give us lovers of the flavor some time to stock up."
19_bj,Nicki237,2017-08-20,3,Decadent,2,26,"I just recently bought this at My local publix and wanted to try something new and picked this up. Very dense chocolatey icecream. Tastes like real chocolate compared to other ice creams but my problem with this is it should've had actual chocolate pudding swirls instead of pudding icecream and the cookies instead taste more like chocolate chips instead of cookies. The icecream also is more of a dark chocolate flavor, slightly bitter. Would've tasted much better if it was chocolate fudge icecream or Milk chocolate icecream but still a good icecream I just wouldn't buy it again"
19_bj,SFMT,2017-06-15,5,My favorite chocolate ice cream by far!,13,0,"I tasted this ice cream for the first time last month. Since then, I've been hooked! It has all of my favorites into one.

19_bj,LainiPaige,2017-06-21,5,Aptly Named,14,0,"This ice cream is exactly what it's title implies - therapy through chocolate, only way cheaper than therapy.

19_bj,Nessyrae23,2017-06-02,4,I love Ben and jerrys chocolate,4,8,I really love Ben and jerrys chocolate ice cream. It's the only chocolate ice cream that tastes like chocolate. I was excited when this came out so I could mix it up a bit and give my tastebuds a chance to miss chocolate fudge brownie. I really like this one but I think the cookies weren't the right choice. I like the pudding ice cream so I think what would've been better would be like a ganache swirl or chocolate frosting. Chocolate cookies aren't very popular to begin with so it wasn't the selling point for me. I wanted to try the chocolate pudding ice cream. Still though it's a rich chocolate ice cream that I enjoy a lot
19_bj,WMKonz924,2017-08-11,5,Can't live without it!!,12,0,I tried this for the first time a few months ago and it is perfect when you need a chocolate fix to make you happy:) It is so creamy then you get the chocolate cookie swirl. I shouldn't admit it but I have at least once a week.

This IS THE quintessential chocolate ice cream for chocolate lovers. The pudding and cookie swirls: totally out of this world chocolate flavor. My phish food and chocolate fudge brownie have competition! If you love chocolate, buy this pint. It won’t disappoint! Sorry for all the exclamation points but I’m serious, you need to be eating this."

The pudding ice cream is an excellent touch and I love that the ice cream is not too milky. The chocolate cookies are a nice touch, although unnecessary to my enjoyment of the experience of eating this wonderful ice cream! Thank you for making a flavor for those of us who believe the only ""real"" and ""tasty"" kind of chocolate is dark chocolate!!"
19_bj,RottenHead,2019-01-24,5,Jesus Has Returned,3,0,"The level of chocolate this product will bring you is mind and body saturating.
If you need love and you are lonely or female and suffering 'that time' just put yourself in the bliss of this ice cream. The pudding ice cream is spiritual. You might need to eat this ice cream away from others, where they cannot see how it makes you feel. You may not be ready for how it makes you feel."

It doesn't get any better.

I couldn't have been more satisfied and have purchased 3 pints of the stuff over the past few weeks. This will indulge all of your deepest chocolate cravings and leave you a bit depressed when you know there's none left in the freezer. it has all the right notes of milk chocolate and dark chocolate and then there's texture of smooth and creamy, pieces of chocolate cookie and/or brownie, and the silky texture of frozen pudding. This is a winner and I hope they never discontinue it."

I went to the scoop shops and they said it was discontinued, this was a few years ago. Well, I begrudgingly made peace with it a while ago. There was always that small voice in my head that said to check the freezer in my grocery store (this is over about 4 different states I've lived in), alas, no dice. Tonight, I have been reunited with my best ice cream best friend, I was at Walmart picking up a few things and that little voice said ""just look for it"". So I did, and there it was. I stood there in pure amazement for a good minute. Never give up hope."
20_bj,ChubbyHubbysMainLady,2018-09-17,5,best ice cream ever!!! No joke,7,0,That if something happened to this flavor of ice cream I would die inside. This has easily become an addiction and I forewarn everyone who dares try it I've been on the hunt for it at every store near me trying to get the sellers nearest me to keep it in stock instead of only Cherry Garcia which I personally a peanut butter pretzel fudge loving person am not very fond of. If this ice cream Chubby Hubby was in fact a Chubby Hubby he would definitely be my hubby of choice. So a huge thank you to those coworkers the pranki. My only complaints are where and what is up with the Froyo version! Please attend issue as soon as possible
20_bj,FuzzyGut,2018-05-31,4,Very good pint,5,0,"I just had my first pint of Chubby Hubby and I thought it was great! The ice cream flavor is delicious. Since my first experience with this flavor was after the change from peanut butter filled pretzels to regular pretzels, I can’t speak to that (though the filled ones do sound great) but the chocolate covered pretzels in the new pints are great! The reason I am giving my review 4 and not 5 stars is because I didn’t get any chocolate peanut butter swirl until the very bottom of the pint. I can imagine that if it had been dispersed throughout, it would have been AMAZING! Still, I will get another of these in the future."
20_bj,KeithMoon78,2019-07-18,3,They ruined a classic! Not the same as before,4,1,"Why tinker with perfection? It appears that Ben & Jerry have changed their ""formula"" for their classic Chubby Hubby flavor, and in doing so have made it far worse. The ice cream used to be fuller and creamier, with peanut-butter filled chocolate covered pretzels and scrumptious robust chunks/gobs of peanut butter. Indeed, quite decadent! Now the ice cream is more ""watery"" (almost like skim milk), the pretzels are no longer filled with peanut butter, and the peanut butter is simply thinly swirled. The result: a pale comparison to its former self; not as rich, not as tasty. Tastes very generic now. Skimping... a sign of the times... Will not be buying again."
20_bj,eliz13413,2019-08-27,4,PLEASE bring back the good pretzels!,3,0,"I just bought this flavor for the first time in two or three years because I was so upset about the change in pretzels a few years back. While the current pretzels are better than the round ones you had for a while, they still don't compare to the yummy peanut-butter filled pretzels of yesteryear. There must be a way for you to source these?? Pretty please?"
20_bj,Sarah2019,2019-02-15,1,Like eating a salt lick!,5,4,"I just tried this for the first time and was so excited to find a new ice cream with peanut butter and chocolate! I've never before found an ice cream flavor I just didn't like (and my first job was selling ice cream, so I've tried a lot!). I wanted to love it, but after a few bites, I found one of the pretzels, and it was so salty! I thought it was a fluke, but I soon found another that was worse. It took a few minutes for the salt to dissolve in my mouth. Now I LOVE a sweet/salty combination, but I would have gotten less salt licking our Michigan winter roads. I hope this was a bad batch, but I won't be taking my chances."

There's just something MAGICAL about the formula of malt vanilla ice cream, with just the right amount of peanut butter and fudge swirling through, and the crunchy chocolate-covered pretzel nuggets embedded within---this combination is something close to ice cream heaven!!! Love digging into the pint, savoring the rich ice cream, and uncovering those awesome chocolate-covered pretzel nuggets---like mining for gold. Please, Ben & Jerry's, NEVER EVER discontinue this AMBROSIAL flavor!!!! And THANK YOU for providing me with such a great experience through your ice cream!!! :)))"
20_bj,Chubster,2020-04-22,5,Actually better than before.,1,0,"This is hands down my favorite ice cream on the planet. I guess I'm fortunate that I almost never find it in stores, because i can't see it without buying it. A lot of people have complained about the change from Chocolate covered peanutbutter FILLED pretzels to chocolate covered peanutbutter pretzels (it is my understanding that this was due to the original pretzels no longer being available to B&J's). While I do thing that the original was better in principal, I found that I frequently got pints where the pretzels were soggy and disappointing. I have never had that happen with the new recipe. The new pretzels are always crunch and a little bit saltier, which I actually prefer; I need the salt to balance the fudge and vanilla malt. Still the best!"
20_bj,Erin,2017-04-11,5,Yum!,4,0,"This is my new favorite flavor, tried it for the first time about 2months ago."
20_bj,Mia Oxford,2018-07-02,2,Disappointing :(,1,0,Wanted to try this since it seemed like a popular classic flavor. Sorry to say it was disappointing to me. The pint I got contained mostly chewy pretzels instead of crunchy ones. It also seemed that there were peanut pieces that were chewy. I liked the crunchy but the chewiness was an odd texture.
20_bj,Artfreak06,2018-02-11,1,This was my husband's favorite,4,1,"We just recently it found chubby hubby at Meijer yesterday and my husband got excited because it's his favorite ice cream. We just ate it and it wasn't the same. The pretzels are supposed to be filled with peanut butter, not coated. I personally couldn't taste the peanut butter at all and the pretzels were too chewy. We will probably not be biting this flavor ever again."
20_bj,uhhuhkayla,2018-02-24,4,it was the best,3,0,this was my favorite up until the pretzels were no longer filled. it gave the ice cream that soft texture nw it has too much crunch and will never be the same. still good but not great and can never find it anywhere lately
20_bj,Mermaid023,2018-01-24,2,Pretzels Suck,3,0,Bring back the old pretzels or find a new peanut butter pretzel cause these chocolate covered ones aren’t the same. Changes the ice cream completely so people don’t buy this flavor anymore
20_bj,Tombonannoo,2017-11-16,3,Nt as good as before,3,0,"I used to love this icecream with the nice crunchy pieces of pretzel, now the pretzels are really chewy and at times really un enjoyable, still a great ice cream though"

20_bj,LarryPA,2018-02-17,3,Used to be my favorite,2,0,"The last time I had Chubby Hubby was when the pretzels were filled with peanut butter. I then tried it again and found no peanut butter in the pretzels. No doubt this was a change due to cost, but something was different with the overall flavor. Just not my favorite anymore. So unfortunate."
20_bj,IceCreamCouple,2018-01-11,3,Amazing but still disappointed,3,3,My girlfriend and I thought this was our new favorite flavor (actually got on here to review how amazing it is) then we began reading other reviews only to realize the pretzels used to be filled with peanut butter. We now can’t stop thinking about how much better that would taste. It has ruined our night. We are the type to obsess over something like this. Will be awake for next 4 days thinking about that peanut filled pretzels. Smh. (But buy the flavor. It’s amazing)

My only complaint is that it can be difficult to locate! I stock up whenever I find it though! Thanks Ben & Jerry for the most fabulous ice cream, ever!!!"
20_bj,bananni,2018-06-17,4,"Great, but used to be excellent!",2,0,"Chubby hubby is one of my favorite Ben & Jerry flavors, however the pretzels used to be stuffed with peanut butter a few years ago. It was WAY better then! I hope you consider going back the old way!"

This is the perfect food. I often go on extended diets, and they are almost bookended with a pint of Chubby Hubby. It's honestly one of the only things that keep me going in life. The crispiness and the saltiness of the pretzel, combined with the sweet and chewy peanut butter swirls. It's just incredible."
20_bj,Kikimocha,2018-02-26,5,Only Ice Cream I Will Buy at the Grocery Store,1,0,"I LOVE this flavor! Only ice cream I will buy at the store for the past 6 years now I even got my family hooked on it as well. A lot of people are mentioning the pretzels, but I love the extra crunch. There is already a peanut butter swirl and a little peanut butter goes a long way since it is a strong flavor. Thank you for making this ice cream and please please please never get rid of it."
20_bj,Chubby Hubby and wife,2018-02-13,5,Couldn't ask for a better treat!,1,0,My husband and I have been buying this ice cream flavor for about 6 months now. We are obsessed with this flavor. Chubby Hubby ice cream is addicting. We're just disappointed it doesn't come in a bigger size than pint and the pretzels are no longer filled with pb. I love the chewy pretzels. It adds character to the ice cream!!! Thank you for this yummy delightful flavor!
20_bj,e4tami,2017-06-21,1,it's ALL hard dry pretzels,3,4,"Unbelievable that they changed the pretzels that used to be chocolate covered and chocolate filled and now they are plain, dry, with something they ""call"" chocolate covering them but it's just brown lard and there are SO many of them, hardly any ice cream, of course because they are cheap compared to cream, that one cannot even scoop the ice cream because the scooper keeps kitting pretzels, like big rocks when digging in dirt."
20_bj,shanelee266,2018-08-08,3,Average Ben and Jerry's is still pretty great,1,0,"Ben and Jerry's is my splurging ice cream. Once a month I buy two pints. I always tell myself I'll make them last the entire month, and instead I'm ice cream-less for about 25 days until I buy more."
20_bj,Sadsherri,2018-03-14,2,Disappointed,2,1,"My first taste of Ben&Jerry's was about twenty years ago. It was Chubby Hubby when the ice cream was peanut butter. Who had the lame brain idea to change it to vanilla malt? That ruined what was so special about it. Sadly, none of the current peanut butter offerings live up to the old Chubby Hubby."
20_bj,Ob95,2017-09-25,1,Basically a pint of pretzels,3,3,"I was extremely disappointed with this flavor. It was almost impossible to eat because every bite was a chunk of pretzel. The little ""vanilla"" ice cream in the pint was almost sour and not the same as the regular vanilla flavor. Not to mention I didn't see a single bit of peanut butter."
20_bj,Hopeful,2018-01-13,5,The best Title/Name ever! It makes me smile!,1,0,"I have been eating Chubby Hubby since its inception! The name made me laugh so I tried it! What could be better than pretzels,peanut butter and chocolate!
Please don’t ever discontinue this yummy and fun ice cream!"
20_bj,WestTexSuz,2019-05-17,2,Just not the same...,0,0,"After not seeing this, my favorite flavor, for years, I was really excited when I saw it in the freezer section! Malted milk vanilla ice cream, peanut butter and fudge swirls and, the best part, chocolate covered, peanut butter filled, pretzels, Oh My. Unfortunately, the new rendition of this flavor is missing the peanut butter filled part of the pretzel which makes it just a dry chunk of pretzel covered in a thin layer of chocolate. It's OK but now where near as good as the original."
20_bj,KimBeth,2020-02-23,3,Bring Back The Old,0,0,"This ice cream used to have more of an intense malt flavor--now the flavor of malt is lacking. The base of the ice cream used to be more like marbled fudge with thick swirls of peanut butter--now the base of the ice cream is vanilla with thin swirls of peanut butter and fudge. The pretzels used to be filled with peanut butter and covered with thick chocolate to keep the pretzels from losing texture--now the pretzels are not filled with peanut butter and the chocolate coating is not thick enough to prevent the pretzels from becoming soggy. I'm assuming the company did this to trim calories but if people want to be on a diet, we wouldn't be buying premium ice cream. Although this flavor is still good, it does not have the perfection it used to have years ago. Please go back to the original!!!"
20_bj,lovemyboys,2017-05-12,5,I love this flavor!!!!,1,0,I love this flavor so much and I am so mad because I CANT find it at any store. I have looked in 3 different states (I move a lot) and none of them sell it anymore!!!!!!!
20_bj,Kamk,2019-01-24,2,Ruined an iconic flavor,0,0,"Bring the old pretzels back. Used to be my addiction and would woof down the whole thing in one setting. I know that the old pretzels sometimes got soggy but when they did not, the whole thing tated sublime. Now, the pretzels are huge lumps, crunchy but fairly tasteless and not stuffed with peanut butter. Plus, I almost always get one or two super super salty (as if I crunched a lump of salt) pretzels that ruin the whole experience. Do something to fix and save this amazing flavor!"

20_bj,Robin O,2019-04-11,5,Favorite Ice Cream Ever,0,0,"So, I spent a few months trying to explore as many Ben&Jerry's flavors as I could, but I've come to the conclusion that this is my favorite ice cream flavor EVER! I grew up drinking vanilla malt milkshakes with my dad and this ice cream base is perfectly that. I love the fudge swirls, they have a very classic chocolate syrup taste. They're not too overpowering! Always so many pretzels too! This ice cream is a no brainer for me. Team Chubby Hubby 5ever. <3"
20_bj,Uncle Gingy,2020-01-14,3,Disappointing pretzel evolution,0,0,Grew up loving this ice cream. Rarely would get anything else. Was disappointed in The change from chocolate cover peanut butter FILLED pretzels to simply chocolate covered but was able to look the other way as the peanut butter swirl still meet my needs. Once they changed those pretzels to way over loaded salty pretzels is been really disappointing. Thought maybe I was crazy but finally came to the website to see I am not the only one who feels this way.
20_bj,Sarasota Florida Girl,2020-06-07,5,All time favorite!,0,0,"Chubby Hubby was the stuff of my childhood dreams and has been my favorite flavor ever since tasting my first scoop many years ago (more than I care to admit or try and number). I will not even be in the mood for ice cream, and yet I still check to see if it's in stock, any time I pass an ice cream selection in any store ever. Simply the best! If you haven't tried it yet, you are missing out. But that's fine, because it leaves me more pints."
20_bj,ChilliedLaura,2018-01-17,5,Peanut butter and Pretzel Delight!,1,1,"I kept hearing about the hype around this one and had to try it for myself, I was not let down. The pretzels were by far the BIGGEST chunks in a Ben & Jerry's ice cream I have tried thus far, combine that with a little peanut butter and it is just pure heaven!"

Last year I was in Hawaii and was delighted to find Chubby Hubby readily available there. I certainly took advantage of that availability while I was there, but I'm back in Singapore now, with no Chubby Hubby. Please make it available in Singapore!"
20_bj,kirsten28,2020-09-05,5,Always a favorite,0,0,"The ice cream is one of the few malt flavors and if that’s not enough to be incredible, the salty and sweet of the chocolate with the pretzels just make it amazing. The pretzels aren’t soggy since the chocolate makes a perfect shell, and there’s the perfect ratio of chunky to ice cream itself. I really hope this one sticks around forever because it ROCKS."
20_bj,Phoenix87,2019-12-17,3,Missing the classic recipe!!!,0,0,"This used to be my absolute favorite flavor. How I miss the chocolate covered peanut butter filled pretzels of the original, classic, version of Chubby Hubby! Never mess with a great. Every time I think I will give it another try, I am dissapointed because I still remember how truly great flavor originally was and miss that this version falls short."
20_bj,Bakerfam,2019-01-08,3,Please make a non dairy version!,0,0,This I've cream is by far my husbands very favorite ice cream. Our only problem is that we have had to go vegan for our health and can no longer consistently dairy or eggs. Would you please consider making a non dairy vegan version of this with the crunchy peanut butter pretzels please! We have had 2 of the vegan flavors and they were great!

The saltiness of the pretzels was great with the sweet ice cream! The malt flavor of the ice cream was also great along side the huge swirls and fudge and peanut butter!
20_bj,rsquare,2020-08-18,5,Absolutely delicious!,0,0,"This ice cream flavor is the best. The malted vanilla is already delicious on its own, and yet it melds so wonderfully with the peanut butter and fudge swirls. The stars of the show, though, are the pretzel pieces - crunchy, sweet, and salty perfection. Absolute joy in a pint!"
20_bj,Beepboop,2018-08-06,4,My fave flavor for 15 years,0,0,This is my favorite flavor but I’ve noticed over the last couple of years it’s tasted much sweeter. It’s missing the over the top peanut butter that I fell in love with. It used to have a better balance of sweet and salty. It’s still great but I wish it hadn’t changed. ❤️

20_bj,Sweetcharity,2018-08-12,5,The best ice cream ever,0,0,"I happened upon Chubby Hubby ice cream at my neighborhood CVS. I had a hankering for some Ben & Jerry’s (my absolute favorite brand), and decided to open up the CVS ice cream vault of awesomeness. Low and behold I saw the funniest name I had ever see labeled on an ice cream, “Chubby Hubby”. I laughed, read the description and the story behind it, and thought that I had to buy this even if it wouldn’t fall into my “favorites” category .
I was wrong in so many ways! I fell in love with this ice cream! The peanut butter and the chocolate covered pretzels...... my mouth is watering right now as we speak! Ha ha ha!
My husband, family, and friends all know that if they want to put a smile on my face, simply buy this ice cream for me. In fact, the hubbs has replaced flowers with Chubby Hubby ice cream and it may have saved our marriage multiple times (I also may be a tad dramatic).
I believe they should rename this “Chubby Wifey” because I’m pretty sure I will get that way if I keep eating this at the rate I am.

20_bj,devnall,2019-10-25,5,One of the two best B&J flavors ever,0,0,Chubby Hubby has been a favorite of mine for decades. It seemed to completely disappear from shelves for quite a few years but recently I've started running across it again in stores and am delighted.
21_bj,jwhgg7,2018-08-17,3,Great flavor but hardly any chocolate chips,2,0,"I was sad to give a mediocre rating because I really loved the flavor of this ice cream. I have never had banana ice cream before and B&J does it perfectly. The addition of walnuts and chocolate pieces makes this flavor simple but delicious. Maybe it was an isolated incident, but my pint had very few chocolate pieces. I think I was averaging 1 chocolate piece for every 4 scoops of ice cream. That's not great, especially since the image on the label shows it being riddled with chocolate. I am hoping this was an isolated incident and the next chunky monkey pint will be better."
21_bj,Wendy,2017-10-23,5,Heaven!,17,2,If I didn't know any better I would've thought this flavor was made with love and some type of witchcraft- it's that good! ❤️
21_bj,,2018-10-10,1,Chunky Monkey missing the chunky,3,2,"This is my favorite ice cream ever! I buy it by the pint and in a Chunky Monkey waffle cone whenever I can find a B&J store.
I was shocked to find only banana ice cream, not one walnut or piece of chocolate."
21_bj,Munica28,2019-09-15,1,"Hey, where are the chocolate chunks???",11,12,"I bought this at my local grocery store. I almost always buy Cherry Garcia but they were out. My next go to, plain ol' vanilla was not available either. I decided to try something new, normally I'm not adventurous with my food. I decided on trying Chunky Monkey because I love bananas. I opened my pint a few nights later, took my first spoon full and there were no chocolate chunks and very little walnuts. I kept digging and nada. The ice cream was very tasty and smooth. The walnuts had a nice nutty toasted flavor. Still, no chocolate chunks. It wasn't until I got to the bottom of the pint a few nights later did I find THREE chocolate chunks. Not cool, not cool at all."
21_bj,Ancy,2017-09-27,5,The banana base is FLAWLESS!,13,1,"I tried this flavor for the first time a few months ago, and albeit I'm not much of an ice cream person as it is, I CANNOT stop buying myself a pint each week! It is SO SO good. The banana base is perfection! I honestly don't even need the walnuts and the chocolate, although the walnuts are absolutely amazing in it... They completely NAILED the banana ice cream. Just....wow. <3"
21_bj,Tallie,2019-06-07,5,Was skeptical,9,0,Tried this flavor today I was unsure about the bannna flavor but got it anyway it is so good. Bananas flavor was perfect wasn't overpowering the chocolate pieces were good tastes like good quality chocloate. I will get again
21_bj,TheTyGuy,2020-04-03,1,"I’m sorry, but no.",1,7,"Being a lover of ice cream, bananas, chocolate, and all forms of nuts, I expected to like this ice cream much more than I did. After the first few bites into the pint, I realized how gross the banana flavor in it is. This might just be me, but I did not like the flavor. Eating into it some more, I noticed a stinging in the back of my throat, I think because of the fudge pieces. It was an acidic sting the more I ate, and the worse it got the more I ate, so I ended up throwing away the pint soon after I started."

I am so disappointed. Halfway through my pint and have only found 3 chocolate chunks. The ones I did find were delicious!
21_bj,Rileyhd,2017-10-11,5,Nice flavor,0,0,"Got this instead of the mint to switch things up and let me tell you, I LOVE THIS. Great banana flavor. Everytime I take a bite with the fudge chunks it tastes like a chocolate covered banana"
21_bj,,2019-02-27,5,"AMAZING, but needs more chocolate.",0,0,"Okay I absolutely love this ice cream, it is my favorite Ben and Jerry's flavor in fact. It's hard to choose the best part, but it is the chocolate chunks. After an intense amount of research I was unable to find what kind of chocolate was used in the ice cream. I would pay a lot of money to eat a chocolate bar made out of the kind of chocolate used in chunky monkey. So, as far as I'm concerned if you would like to keep my business you have two choices: 1. Add much more chocolate to pint of ice cream like advertised or 2. make chocolate bars. Thanks and have a great day."
21_bj,CHUNKY MONKEY CONNOISSEUR,2017-12-06,5,LOVE AT FIRST TASTE,1,0,"I've been a Chunky Monkey fan for over 15 years now. I moved from New Jersey to Alabama to find out the quality is not the same. I've notice less chocolate chunks and the ice cream has a gritty texture. Not sure why the disparities but I look forward to going home (Jersey) for Christmas. I have a suggestion, PLEASE consider selling in half gallon or gallon sizes. This would make my life complete. Thank You for a delicious product"

I used to make my banana shake with oats and milk...I gave that up to have this. My local grocery store was out so I decided to try the ""Almond Milk"" and I can tell you I was disappointed. The texture was not the same...it tasted like regular chunky monkey but expired."
21_bj,JackieM,2019-05-10,5,Reminds me of my childhood favorite ice cream,1,0,"I absolutely love this Ice cream but I 100% could go without the walnuts, I don't really like those in there, I feel like the walnuts should be replaces with a lot more chocolate chunks. Breyers used to sell a banana ice cream with chocolate chips when I was younger but discontinued it and I was so unhappy! But this one is great, but again, a lot less walnuts or removing them completely would be great."

My biggest disappointment is I can't get it anymore.
I moved from Montreal Que, to Saint John NB and there isn't a single store anywhere I can find it. My freezer used to have a pile of steak and a pile of Chunky Monkey."
21_bj,Cam_,2018-03-19,5,Simply great taste (:,1,0,"First Ice cream flavor I had ever tried.. and wow. All I can say is this is nothing compared to any other Ice cream companys Ive tried throughout my childhood years till now. All though I can say is I do wish It had a great price where other buyers are able to afford it such as myself. But overall, I think this flavored Ice cream should be one of your GREAT classics."
21_bj,issa,2018-05-09,3,Too chunky!!,1,0,This is honestly my top favorite flavor ever but I wish the chocolate and nut chunks were smaller... when chocolate freezes it gets even harder to chew and it hurts my teeth so I usually eat around the bigger pieces and just eat the smaller ones!
21_bj,Zucks29,2020-08-01,4,Very good!,1,0,"Love this flavor, rarely is banana done right. Only reason it’s not 5 stars is that I feel as though the walnut and chocolate pieces should be smaller so that the ice cream is more easily consumed when it is really cold."
21_bj,Vero,2017-08-30,3,"Good, but little to no chocolate :/",1,0,The banana flavor is soooo good but I literally got 2 chocolate pieces which was kind of disappointing. Maybe I'll give it another chance.
21_bj,HayyHayy,2020-02-16,5,MY FAVORITE ICE CREAM EVER,0,0,Every time I go grocery shopping I buy 5 pints (which I go every week because I’m a college student) I wish I could buy more but I’m a broke college student. I go thru a pint every night. One day I walked to family dollar up the street because I thought they had it but they didn’t. After leaving family dollar I walked to multiple corner stores and they didn’t have it and they weren’t close either I was so depressed and sad when I went back to my dorm room. But I eat this ice cream almost every week. I just wanna say if you guys ever have a contest for a giveaway for this specific ice cream for months or a year I am entering and ima do everything to win! Love this ice cream out of all the Ben & Jerry ones ive had. I’ve even made my family start eating this one and one of my family members don’t even like bananas. Lol
21_bj,Marky Mark,2019-09-01,4,Surprisingly amazing flavor,1,0,"I am a chocoholic and will almost never buy any ice cream with any fruit associated with it but I decided to be open minded with this and give it a shot, so trust me when I say that this stuff is absolutely amazing. I was afraid that it was going to have a very strong banana flavor but it doesnt at all. It doesnt taste like a frozen banana or a banana smoothie or the artificial banana you see in popiscles and candy. Instead, the masterminds created a perfect harmony of sweet cream, vanilla, and banana that keeps it from being boring and the texture is out of this world, better than any soft serve i have ever had with it's creaminess and density. The only reason i am not giving this a 5 stars review is because i didnt care for the walnuts or the fudge chunks. They could have left them out completely and that would have been perfectly okay with me or have gone with milk chocolate chunks or peanut butter cups. Still, this ice cream is one of their best and one of the best i have ever had and i am shocked to say that about a fruit flavored ice cream. I was so impressed with the flavor that went out the next day to buy another pint. Now I know why it's a top seller year after year."

21_bj,Gibby,2020-03-29,5,The Umami of Ice Creams. Change My Mind.,0,0,"Incredible real banana flavor, dark chocolate chunks at the size you DREAM all chunks should be at, and fatty walnuts to die for. So many other ice creams are sugar OVERLOADS. This flavor does not have to rely of excessive sugar to be great. Chunky Monkey is the umami of ice creams. Change my mind. Also, BRING IT BACK. My local stores are falling short. -Richmond, CA 94805."

I keep saying I’m going to try another flavor, but it’s so hard. I love Ben & Jerry’s. There is no other ice cream that can compare to their ice cream. I mean every bite there is goodness! And anyone who knows me knows that I am not sharing my “Chunky Monkey”"
21_bj,Clark,2018-08-07,5,A masterpiece of a flavor,0,0,"I'd normally be skeptical of nuts in ice cream, but the walnuts and chocolate chunks in this flavor are just what the absolutely delicious banana ice cream calls for.

21_bj,Syd555,2018-06-04,5,Banana ice cream is perfect,0,0,"I loved the banana ice cream, it didn’t have that artificial banana flavor. Combined with the walnuts reminded me of banana bread. I didn’t care for the chocolate chunks, I wish there was a fudge swirl instead. I wish there was another banana flavor combined with peanut butter, caramel, or cheesecake."

Of days ago and baaabbbby.... let me tell you, this is the BEST ice cream flavor I have ever tasted. I love Coldstone’s banana ice cream but it has nothing on Ben & Jerry’s Chunky Monkey!!! It is perfection! Perfect flavor and perfect chunks! A new staple in my house!"
21_bj,Shake,2017-06-29,1,Not a Fan,2,9,The banana ice cream is overpowering and struggles to compliment the chocolate and nuts. I ate a quarter of it and threw the rest away.

21_bj,Yummmmm,2020-06-29,5,Delicious!!,0,0,I just tried this flavor and it's delicious!! The ice cream tastes exactly like frozen bananas with no after taste. The nuts and chocolate pieces are definitely a plus. I always loved Ben & Jerry ice cream and this will be one of my new favorites!

22_bj,Dnice,2017-06-05,5,Top 5 flavor hands down!!,12,0,This is one of the best ice cream flavors I have ever had. It is probably more like top 3 flaovr for me and I have tried a lot of ice cream. It is bursting with cinnamon flavor and is unlike any flavor I have ever had. I got my Mom hooked on it now. If there is EVER even a thought of retiring this flavor I would have to make a trip to Vermont to talk to the CEO of Ben and Jerrys. It is that good.

Drove to the store and could hardly wait to taste it when i got home and....... I was disappointed :( Although the cinnamon flavor was delicious and definitely there, the cinnamon bun dough pieces that other reviewers were raving about just weren't there for me. The dough was VERY dry and crumbly, NOT at all soft and gooey like others have claimed. Not sure if mine was a bad batch but unfortunately I was very disappointed."

I taste morning breakfast at grandmas with a cinnamon bun in my mouth melting my tastebuds. Ben and jerry all I can say is you succeeded everything and beyond. Thank you for being you and all you do to make these flavors. You always have my support. Never again will I have another brand of ice cream outside of Ben and Jerry’s. Thank you. I love you. Goodnight"
22_bj,OnereviewEric,2018-10-05,2,Disappointed,5,2,"I purchased this flavor after reading how great it was on reddit.
I can honestly say I’m very disappointed.The cinnamon bun dough are like gobs of gritty sugar. The caramel ice cream is ok. Almost like eating liquified brown sugar pop tarts.
I’ll stick with cherry Garcia"
22_bj,FuzzyGut,2018-06-10,5,YUM! Absolutely delivers on its title!,2,0,"All I can say about this one is that it’s perfect! The ice cream is great, the bun dough chunks are perfect and the streusel swirl is SUBLIME! I let mine melt for just a few minutes to get it even gooier! This is a great flavor pint and was just a little sad when I finished it."

It's fulfilled my love for cinnamon and is my favorite flavor in the world! As of March 2019, however...I never see it in my area. My college town and my hometown don't seem to sell it ANYWHERE! I actually cried on my mom's birthday over it, how embarrassing. It truly is the best ice cream in the entire world. I miss it so much."
22_bj,SamanthaAnn25,2019-02-07,5,Best Flavor EVER!!,1,0,"The first time I tried this was a few months ago and man, have I been missing out!! This stuff is heaven in a little pint.. I'm kind of glad these are sold in smaller amounts sometimes.. because its so addicting you almost want to eat the whole thing in one sitting!! I try to make it last but its so difficult! Lol <3
Please do NOT ever think of discontinuing this flavor... 'cuz its the bees knees! Haha! :)"
22_bj,Thom,2018-06-26,1,Strange texture,2,1,"I ran to the store to try a new flavor and just opened a pint of this today and was disappointed in the quality of the buns dough... the dough tasted old and was too hard. I tried leaving it to sit out for a while to see if it had just needed to thaw a bit, but that did not do the trick, also there were big almost sugar cubes between the ice cream. :("
22_bj,Scott_56,2019-09-03,5,Cinnamon Dreams are made of this,1,0,"Look no further, Cinnamon fanatics. This is the flavor you've been waiting for. The gooey swirl will keep you diving back in with your spoon, and if you're lucky you'll come up with some cinnamon bun dough too. I've considered buying an extra freezer dedicated to pints of this flavor. I can only hope it sticks around!"
22_bj,Brie,2020-04-29,5,Cinnamon Lovers Delight!,1,0,Finally decided to try this flavor today and my goodness I was NOT disappointed. That streusel swirl is heaven! And the dough pieces remind me more like giant frozen pieces of crumb topping. Like the kind on top coffee cake with is HEAVEN. I definitely need some warm coffee cake to plop a scoop of this deliciousness on!
22_bj,lala4now,2019-04-18,5,Like a cinnamon bun in ice cream form,1,0,"I just tried this flavor for the first time and it's my new favorite flavor. It's everything I hoped it would be - from the ice cream itself to the cinnamon swirls, streusel pieces and cookie dough. Absolutely delicious. If you love the rich, indulgent gooeyness of a fresh cinnamon roll you'll love this flavor."
22_bj,Durban,2019-03-01,3,Mostly good,1,0,I was super excited to stumble upon this flavor. It was delicious other than the cinnamon bun dough bites. The dough had a weird taste and after a few pieces i could only describe it as a black licorice flavor. I mostly picked out the dough pieces and was able to enjoy the rest of the ice cream!
22_bj,Flip08,2017-08-26,5,Skeptical,1,0,"I have to admit that I was a little skeptical about this when I bought it, so I bought a backup pint of Americone Dream just in case. I have never eaten a pint of B&Js so fast in my life.....it was amazing !!!!! Keep it coming B&Js.....Cinnamon Buns has officially entered my top 5"
22_bj,ToplessJeepChick,2018-08-06,5,Heaven in a Pint!,1,0,"Love, love, love this flavor!! It used to be harder to find, but lucky me it started showing up in more places. This is by far my most favorite ice cream flavor. I never get tired of it and when I do try other flavors although I enjoy them I always go back to my cinnamon buns!!"
22_bj,SBayjj,2019-07-08,3,Sweet!,1,0,"There is nothing I love better than a cinnabon bun. However, for me, this did not translate well into ice cream. Maybe i'm getting older, but this flavor is over the top sweet for me. And that is saying a lot. Sorry, I won't be buying this one again."
22_bj,SuzeQ,2017-10-05,5,Omg I can't live without this!,1,0,"As a chocoholic, it's a pretty big deal when I will always choose this ice cream flavor over any chocolate flavor. Please don't ever retire this flavor! I could not live with out my cinnamon buns ice cream!!!"
22_bj,LAURENC,2020-06-14,5,"So good, so hard to find!",1,0,I actually came here to figure out if Cinnamon Buns is just a seasonal flavor. Why is it so hard for all of us to find (I've now read everyone else's comments). Please deliver more everywhere!!!
22_bj,Cms2191,2018-05-22,5,FAVORITE ice cream,1,0,This is by far my favorite ice cream. I'm not always a big ice cream person but I always end up eating the whole pint of this stuff. Tastes just like a cinnamon roll!

22_bj,SugarPlumVixen,2020-01-29,5,Model Of What All Cinnamon Ice Creams Should Be,0,0,"I've never thought that an ice cream would make me feel all warm and gooey and content inside but Ben & Jerry's decided otherwise. I bought this on a whim when my cinnamon loving mother was supposed to visit me but I ended up having to buy a second pint before she even got there. This ice cream has such a pronounced buttery cinnamon flavour to its base, and the dough remains just soft enough so that it really feels like you're biting into a chunk of the thick cinnamon rolls you get at the mall. The cinnamon streusel swirl was probably my favourite part though. My mom and I fought over who got to scoop their spoon through the biggest swirls. Just to note it, my first pint had a lot of swirl while my second had more dough. Both were delightful but I wish it would have been more consistent with more of both aspects please!"

22_bj,dre1018,2017-05-30,5,Amazing!!! Hard to stop eating it!,1,1,"This is my absolute favorite flavor of any ice cream! It might be the swirl. It might be the cinnamon bun chunks but from the moment I taste the first spoonful, it is bliss! It's been a while since I'd seen it but soooo happy I've found it again! Is is loaded with chunks of cinnamon bun like dough. I don't know what it truly is but it is amazing!"
22_bj,Alex576,2019-10-05,1,Super disappointing,1,2,"Not what you'd expect from Ben and Jerry's. If I didn't know better if think it was some cheap store brand. The ""gobs"" of cinnamon roll dough are just those weird sugary chunks like in cheap cookie dough ice cream. Not like any of the other dough in Ben and Jerry's ice cream. I took a few bites and it sat in the freezer for months until we threw it out."
22_bj,DC24,2018-09-04,1,Not This One!,1,1,"Just not enough contrast in this flavor. It simply fails to capture the essence of a delicious cinnamon roll. It was a valiant effort, but it just wasn't enough for me to recommend the product to anyone. I love some of Ben & Jerry's flavors, just not this one!"
22_bj,Jsteps,2017-05-22,5,Only cinnamon bon ice cream,0,0,"B&J Cinnamon bon ice cream is not just the best B&J flavor but also the most unique. I was hooked on this flavor, it was my go-to for a frozen treat. Then it disappeared. I was left feeling empty and unsatisfied. Did you know there's not even a competing cinnamon flavor ice cream made by any other companies? What's the deal with that? Why would cinnamon be so scarce from frozen tastey varieties?! ...heartbroken."
22_bj,atik,2017-11-16,5,Simple but different,0,0,"This isn't one of the Ben and Jerry's crazier flavors where they have unusual combinations of mix ins and flavors, like half baked or milk and cookies. Still, it's an amazing flavor. This flavor is one of my favorite Ben and Jerry's flavors. Everything from the steusel swirls to the dough to the caramel base in this pint is solid, and I can't name anything I would want to change about it."
22_bj,Blancos Girl,2017-09-20,5,AMAZING BUT HARD TO FIND,0,0,"Im telling you this is literally the best flavor!!!! But so hard to find not even the big name brand places like Walgreens and what not have it. Once you do find it it’s EVERYTHING, the chunks of cinnamon are to die for. Every bite is worth the find. Not to say I enjoy scavenging through stores to find it. But it is sooo enjoyable it’s crazy. MAKE IT MORE AVALIBLE PLEASE!"

23_bj,Bean,2018-07-08,5,All time favorite!!,3,0,"Discovered this flavor in a scoop store in Kingston, Ontario years ago. It became my go to flavor. I would hunt it down where ever we moved to. ;) No other coffee ice cream is strong enough and has just the right balance of chocolate and coffee like this one. Got my niece hooked on it too. Sadly she lives in Vienna, Austria and can't get it. Any way this great flavor can make it to the EU?? Please! Lots of Europeans like strong coffee. In the meantime my niece came to visit Boston, MA this summer and she was very excited to have it again. It was a good as she remembered."
23_bj,ccbbb lover,2017-10-19,5,Thank goodness for CCBBB,4,1,"I was so disappointed when my favorite B&J flavor (Coffee Heath Bar Crunch) changed to Coffee Toffee Crunch and the flavor went way down hill. I decided to try CCBBB. It is on beyond delicious. It is how I reward myself after hard work in the garden, or walking with my Mastiff, or other causes for exhaustion or for celebration. When I finished my taxes the first thing I did was grab the CCBBB out of the freezer ..... my reward to myself. I have recommended CCBBB to others and their reactions have been positive. Thank you B&J! By the way --- the Mastiff has to stick to vanilla!"
23_bj,I Love Ice Cream,2017-07-28,5,THE BEST!,7,0,"I am both a chocolate and coffee lover, and this is the single best coffee ice cream I've ever tried. The coffee flavor is so strong and there are many large chunks of rich espresso bean chocolate pieces. So much flavor...this ice cream really does pack a punch. Please NEVER discontinue this flavor, Ben and Jerry's! I stock up every month. :)"
23_bj,,2020-09-21,5,The GOAT of coffee ice cream,3,0,I’ve tried all of the coffee flavored ice cream I can find in local stores and this one is easily the best. My only issue is that’s it’s not carried at many stores and I’ve had trouble finding it in the last month. Thankfully the B&J team assured me it’s not discontinued but the production is behind because of the pandemic. When things are back to normal please get this in more stores so more people will discover this incredibly indulgent and amazing treat!
23_bj,Katie W,2017-04-19,5,Strong,6,0,I bought this after a 3rd shift at work to get me through the rest of morning class at school. Its really quite strong and kept me quite awake!
23_bj,luna09,2017-08-31,5,Simply the best!,3,0,I adore this flavor. I have become quite a fan of stronger coffee over the years so this one is a winner. The coffee ice cream is definitely strong and just sweet enough. The espresso fudge pieces give a nice texture contrast and are a lot like eating chocolate covered espresso beans. Fortunately there are at least a couple stores in my area that have this one and I hope they never stop carrying it. Please never discontinue this flavor.

Oh how I love you coffee coffee buzz buzz! I have tried almost every brand of so called ""coffee"" ice cream and nothing even comes close to the strong, creamy coffee flavor of this wonderful ice cream...can you tell how much I LOVE this ice cream?"
23_bj,Dishon,2017-10-22,5,BEST (next to EVERYTHING BUT THE),2,0,"This is one of my FAVORITES. I first tried this in the B&J on my college campus and fell in love with it. Unfortunately, when I got home, I couldn't find the flavor anywhere I was bummed. That was about 5 years ago. I never wouldve thought to check the company website. I just thought it was a discontinued flavor but NOPE, I see that for my area they're selling it exclusively at Target. Now all I need are coupons."
23_bj,DR725,2018-03-01,5,Absolute All Time FAVORITE FLAVOR!!,2,0,I am literally addicted to this flavor!! I love it!! It’s the best coffee flavored ice cream ever. I know I sound like I’m exaggerating but I honestly mean every word. I buy at least 2 pints every weekend for my cheat meals. Eat like half a pint for the weekend nights. I’ve tried so many other coffee flavors because it’s one of my favorites but this one tops them all the strength of the coffee flavor is the best it doesn’t have that weird too creamy taste it’s just like adding some milk and sugar to a cup of espresso and a side of some dark chocolate which is honestly the best flavor combo ever just pairs so well. And I love the dark chocolate espresso pieces; I used to buy dark chocolate covered espresso beans and eat them and it reminds me of that with the light crunchy-ness of the beans in the chocolate. My literal worst fear is that I go to my grocery store one of these fridays and I find out that this flavor has been pulled or discontinued! If this flavor ever got taken away that would be the worst ever!! I mean I think I buy out this flavor at my store alone and waiting for it to get shipped sucks and is a pain. This is a lot just for a flavor of ice cream but as I said before I love it and I’m addicted to it. It’s the only coffee flavor ice cream I’ll buy. Thank for making it!!

Tried it on a whim, not a coffee drinker or lover of coffee, but because the store did not have my normal go-to flavor (NY Fudge Chunk), I thought I would give it a try. Now, I am eagerly searching for grocers in my son's home state so that he can buy it and love it too!"

23_bj,Bill13,2018-02-10,5,Lost Product,1,0,I absolutely love this flavor and so many stores near me stopped carrying it. I have actually abandoned a shopping cart and left the store when I found my favorite no longer on the shelf.

23_bj,Good stuff,2019-04-12,5,I live for these,1,0,Really great coffee flavor. These are totally worth trying if you dig coffee flavored ice cream. I would dive over others to get the last one in the case. These really are that good.
23_bj,Amby,2017-07-28,5,Delicious,1,0,This flavor is by far my favorite. If you're a fan of coffee and ice cream I highly recommend trying it. The only disappointment is most stores in my area don't carry it.

23_bj,Lynda with a y,2020-02-22,3,Disappointed,0,1,I was so sad when my favorite coffee Heath bar crunch was replaced by toffee heath bar crunch. It is a total loss of flavor profiles - especially the change to the coffee base. Then the proportions changed in coffee coffee buzz buzz buzz so there is so little coffee ice cream in most of the pints I buy that I end up with at least 1/3 of the pint filled with the excess chocolate pieces after digging thru the pint searching for the tase of the worlds best coffee ice cream. I haven’t stopped buying pints because I love the coffee flavor and a portion of the buzz buzz is perfect.
23_bj,Midnight Rider,2019-07-06,5,My favorite go-to flavor!,0,0,"I love my coffee, and I had high expectations for this when it got my attention. It instantly became my all-time favorite, kicking Americone Dream out of the ring for a while. It's not overly sweet in a toothaching way, and the espresso component isn't bitter either. It's a nice little pick-me up when you're wanting your caffeine fix and a nice way to cool down on a hot day."
23_bj,Tallkid86,2019-11-08,2,No your best work,0,1,"I just recently came across this in the store and thought I would try it because how bad could coffee ice cream be? Unfortunately, I quickly regretted buying this products. The ""coffee"" tasted awful and the chunks tasted weird. Idk if the pint its self was just being sold by the store old but it didn't even look appetizing either."

It gave me a hit of that instant buzz buzz in the surreal shop setting reminiscent of the Grateful Dead & California vibes of the '80's. I could sit with my small son & continue my California Dreamin' of yesteryear.

24_bj,huntp,2018-04-22,1,What a shame they replaced the Heath Bar.,79,29,"I love coffee ice cream and heath bars, but try to eat them infrequently due to needing to watch my sugar and weight. On a nearly 90 degree day here in NH, I decided to indulge. What a horrible disappointment. The ice cream is ok, but after a few bites of toffee, I was done and tossed the pint. I found myself avoiding the crunch. So disappointing. I appreciate your dedication to non GMO, but I prefer strong labeling. I am a big girl, and can make my own choices. I just won't bother with B&J's if they sacrifice taste. This is not health food, there is no way this variant is any better for you than the Heath version, let's not kid ourselves."
24_bj,Eliza,2019-10-28,1,Why isn’t Ben & Jerry’s listening to its consumers,45,15,After you changed the formula and removed heath bars from this ice cream it’s tasted awful. I ate this ice cream every day for years when it was Coffee Heath Bar Crunch. This new Coffee Toffee Crunch is dreadful. Consumers have been complaining since you made the change and you have not improved the ice cream. I know how Business works so I am sure part of the problem is that you are lock into a contract with the new Toffee company but you are losing sales therefore you should get a new supplier. I keep waiting and checking for you to fix this formula so it could taste like it used to. Very disappointed.
24_bj,ToffeeTastesLikePoo,2018-07-10,1,Certifications over Taste,11,0,Not sure why a Ben & Jerry's employee responded to another customer that Coffee Toffee Bar Crunch wasn't a replacement for Coffee Heath Bar Crunch. On this very page you have a video stating: Coffee Heath Bar Crunch has a new name!
24_bj,paige18,2018-08-14,1,Another sad customer longing for heath bar return,23,5,"Anyone who likes this flavor must never have tried Coffee Heath Bar Crunch because this is a sad replacement at best. And yes, I’ve read the multiple replies from B&J staff stating this flavor was not meant to replace it, but as others have pointed out, there is a video on the flavor’s page announcing its ‘new name’. I’ve bought this flavor more than once since its switch years ago, hoping for improvement over time, but still the toffee leaves a terrible aftertaste and the coffee ice cream lacks its once creamy, rich flavor. Ben & Jerry’s commitment to non-GMO products is admirable but please don’t this sacrifice the taste! Bring back the Heath Bar or give us a better replacement!"
24_bj,Jeremy,2018-05-10,1,My favorite snack is no more.,38,6,"I eat a relatively healthy diet and the coffee/toffee Ben and Jerry's was always my one real guilty pleasure that I would indulge in whenever I wanted something sweet. I admire the company's dedication to non-GMO/fair-trade products as I often eat a diet as low in non-GMO products as I can, but this new product really is dreadful. There is little flavor in the ice cream, and the toffee tastes like what you would expect from a sugar-free candy bar. I have bought it twice now, the first time was a surprise, and the second time was me hoping it was just an isolated mistake. Both were bad enough that I threw them away within a few bites. Major disappointment and I hope they take these reviews to heart and reconsider the product change."
24_bj,Holls,2019-08-06,1,"If I could give no stars, I would.",7,1,"Coffee Heath Bar crunch has been my favorite flavor of icecream since I can remember. I decided to try the new product because I figured it wouldn’t be too much different from the original. I can’t pretend to eat it. Knowing what the flavor was to this?! No comparison. I read all of the responses from Ben and Jerry’s on this site and they claim that the point was to not replace the product. If it wasn’t to replace why was Coffee Heath Bar crunch discontinued? Have the Non-GMO (I mean, we’re talking about a treat here) and the original one if it wasn’t meant to be a replacement. I haven’t bought a Ben and Jerry’s product since and I used to have my freezer full. Such a disappointment."
24_bj,Disappointed Customer,2017-06-23,1,It seems no one is listening,32,5,"This ice cream is just disgusting. You say you weren't replacing Coffee Heath Bar Crunch but you were, I red it at the time. I get the GMO thing but as others have said ice cream isn't healthy and we can make our own choices. You keep telling people it is a manufacturing error IT'S NOT the ice cream is just BAD. Why are you treating your loyal customers like this. Fix it or agree that you can't reproduce one of the best flavored ice creams you had. It doesn't make the top 10 anymore but Coffee Heath Bar Crunch was always in the top 10."
24_bj,Cnyc,2017-07-09,1,oh no no it has changed,36,5,"I noticed the name of my favorite ice cream changed in the grocery store today and tried it anyway - I figured swapping toffee bars wouldn't make that big of a difference but the coffee base changed too. It's no longer rich, the toffee no longer produces that sticky liquidy toffee pool. Instead, this toffee melts into a pretty gross dark brown grainy mess. The left over flavor is just yucky. Don't buy this. CHBC is gone and this is not a replacement."
24_bj,Ommmmmm,2019-03-17,1,A poor replacement,3,0,Coffee Heath bar crunch was my favorite flavor.
24_bj,tcwoody99,2017-10-05,1,Disappointed,6,1,"I have recently decided to make my way through all of the B&J flavors (I have gone through an embarrassing number of pints embarrassinly fast..) and this was one that excited me at first sight. I love coffee ice cream and I love toffee, so I thought the two together would be a great mix. Sadly, the coffee flavor was very weak, and the toffee tasted almost metallicy. I thought maybe it was just a bad bite, but every piece of toffee had that same metallic taste, and all of the ice cream that touched the toffee was given that flavor as well. Overall, I was highly disappointed, and very saddened because this was the first flavor I have tried that I did not like. I will be throwing away my pint and not buying this flavor again."
24_bj,brianctoner,2017-04-30,1,Sad Face,21,2,"I love coffee, I love toffee, I don't care for this flavor. Strangely metallic flavored toffee. I bought this a few years ago and hoped that it had improved. Well, it did improve, but it still isn't great. It went from inedible to tolerable. This ice cream tasting bad just makes me sad. I don't want a refund, I don't want coupons, I just want this ice cream to taste good."
24_bj,Madelyn,2018-10-09,1,Yuck!,5,0,"I wish I had read the reviews, this ice cream is disgusting! I love Ben and Jerry’s and like to try new flavors but this was a huge let down. The ice cream has little flavor and the toffee is indescribably bad. Like other reviewers said it tastes metallic and like a sugar free candy. The texture is grainy unlike other Ben and Jerry’s ice creams. I was wondering if I got a weird pint until I read the other reviews. I threw the pint away it, it was inedible. I expect more from Ben and Jerry’s."
24_bj,VellyBelly,2019-10-28,1,Nothing good lasts,21,3,I bought this the other day and was soooooo ready to dig in. Boy was I disappointed. Immediately there was a difference. The coffee has no flavor. It lost all the richness. Oh and the toffee bars. Ugh! Totally gross. This tastes like the diet version. I understand why you guys made the changes and I'm glad to support the cause. I guess I'll just have to find a new ice cream.
24_bj,KentM,2018-07-29,2,Not near good as previous Heath Bar Crunch,5,0,"Wife and I just bought a pint of the Coffee Toffee Bar Crunch because it has been a year at least since we had one. Today was a test to see if maybe had gone back to Heath Bar toffee. NOT. Whatever kind of toffee being used now is, apparently lots less money is the usual reason for change...big mistake. The Heath Bar version, I am betting, far outsold the present blend. The present toffee blend...we did not eat much of the pint, maybe total 3 spoonfulls. The rest...we tossed into trash."
24_bj,,2017-10-15,1,My guilty pleasure is gone,5,0,I used to keep track of what stores had the Coffee Heath Bar Crunch for those times when you just need a good pint of ice cream and a movie. Knowing that it isn't out there anymore is sad in a way the surprises me. And it's not like an old Atari you can find on eBay. It's just... gone. I didn't hear about the change but noticed it was really hard to find the flavor when I was looking for it. Then I found the Coffee Toffee Crunch and thought they might have just changed the name. Then I tasted it and thought I must have gotten a bad pint. Then I read the label and realized my favorite flavor was gone. I can only hope someday they'll bring it back. Maybe Health Bar can meet the free trade non-GMO requirements? What's so wrong with GMO anyway? Isn't that just called science? Isn't that how we cure disease?
24_bj,,2019-03-17,5,Love the coffee and the toffee!,2,0,Maybe it's because I had never tried the original. But I love this flavor! It is one of my go tos! The coffee ice cream is delicious and the toffee is a tasty buttery crunch! Mmmm!
24_bj,Zorg,2020-06-12,2,Bring Back the Original,2,1,"Let me be clear: I want to give this 1 star for how disappointed I am. I threw in the extra recognition because the idea is amazing. I was fortunate enough to try the original with Heath, but sometimes I wish I never knew how heavenly it was. It hurts so much to lose my favorite ice cream flavor strictly due to an ingredient change. The toffee is mediocre and reminds me of the cheap caramel from my childhood. It’s a critical difference from the original, more buttery and crunchy delight. Please, for my sanity, bring back the original flavor or just put this flavor to rest. I can’t take any more disappointment when I see it next to my second favorite flavor, skipping this one every time..."
24_bj,Me2me,2018-01-11,1,Doesn't taste right,4,1,"I'm so upset at the taste of this ice cream that I made my way to you're website just to express my concerns. Okay so I love coffee, especially coffee ice cream. When I stumbled upon this ice (which was in sale) I thought I found a a yummy treat. Boy was u wrong and disappointed. The coffee flavor isn't bad. But the toffee. Yuck. It has like a sour milk metal taste to it. And no its not expired and in eating the ice cream with a plastic spoon. Something is just not right. And with the other reviews, I know it's not only me who feels this way."
24_bj,GiantBlue2,2018-01-10,1,Never again!,4,1,"I rarely buy B&J's but the CHBC was my fave, so when asked what kind of ice cream I wanted with Christmas dessert it was the first thing I thought of. I could hardly wait! Imagine the disappointment when met with this horrid excuse for coffee/toffee ice cream! I get the whole non-GMO thing, but is there no one making a decent non-GMO toffee bar that you could use? One bite and I knew it wasn't Heath - though I hadn't heard you were making a change. I complained pretty vocally so my sister actually showed me the container to prove it wasn't a generic brand. It was then that I noticed the change in the name. I wish I had known. What a waste! If Karamel Sutra wasn't so good, I wouldn't even look at the Ben & Jerry's section of my store's freezer."
24_bj,Sijnaanik,2018-05-03,1,WHY????,6,1,"Coffee Heath Bar Crunch was one of my favorite ice creams of all time, but I can't even eat this. I get that some people have an irrational fear of GMOs, but that is no reason to manufacture a bad-tasting product. If you really can't use Heath then find some other toffee that tastes good; I imagine it can't be that hard to do. Until then I'm not buying this (and since you discontinued most of my other favorites, my overall Ben and Jerry's purchases have been and will be infrequent)."
24_bj,lily14,2017-08-31,1,Gross,4,0,"Awful, metallic, bland taste. CHBC was infinitely better. Although B&J claims it was not a replacement, despite being dished out directly after CHBC was discontinued, it is clear that this was meant to appease CHBC lovers. B&J could not have been farther off in this assumption. This ice cream went straight into the trash after five people took a bite and determined something was ""off"" years ago. It was purchased again recently with the same conclusion. Awful."
24_bj,nyc ice cream,2017-04-25,1,Awful since they dropped the heath bars,13,2,"Coffee Heath Bar Crunch was my favorite B&J flavor. Bought this when they first made the change and thought I'd gotten a spoiled batch.

Awful, and substitution for the old delight that was Coffee Heath Bar Crunch— a flavor to which I would credit my bachelor degree, as it did its part in getting me through college."
24_bj,Liz88,2017-05-28,1,If you can't do it with the heath bar....,4,0,So coffee Heath bar crunch was my jam. I agree with many of the other reviewers that the toffee used now for this ice cream is really bad and leaves a bitter taste.... so disappointing because the old version was amazingly delicious. I know your comitting to non-gmo products so perhaps partner with a different toffee maker? or make a plain coffee ice cream. B&J's coffee ice cream base is great so I I would just buy that and buy my own Heath bars!!!
24_bj,DisappointedPortland,2018-09-03,1,Unfortunate ... not at all the taste I remember.,6,0,"I love the coffee flavors from Ben and Jerry’s and “Coffee Heath Bar Crunch” was my all time favorite so I figured this might come close... and no, sadly it doesn’t. The toffee is grainy and sweet, tastes very little of anything. The coffee ice cream is much less richly flavored, sigh. I had a few bites and tossed the pint."
24_bj,Whale,2018-03-10,1,Worst Marketing Choice Ever,6,2,"I understand what Ben&Jerry's is trying to do, but I no longer have a Ben&Jerry's flavor that I like enough to buy. Coffee Heath Bar Crunch was my favorite flavor and I bought it every single week. I tried this new one, thinking it must be the same thing with a new name; However, this toffee is horrible and almost tastes metallic. The taste of the ice cream is completely different. You're better off just buying a different brand of plain coffee ice cream and adding Heath Bars, or whatever toffee you enjoy, to that."
24_bj,William Q,2018-02-01,5,BEST FLAVOR EVER!!!,5,4,"I can't believe I am seeing these negative review's. I am a fan of ice cream in general. I live in Schenectady NY and if anyone doesn't know this where some of the best ice cream in the country comes from. That said... This is my absolute FAVORITE flavor of all time. Awesome flavors. Together! But it is hard to find now and there's similar flavors out there but none with big chunks of toffee in it! Plus the coffee flavor compliments the toffee so well. I usually stick to my local brands, but this is by far one of the best out there!!! Why can't I find it anywhere guys!?"
24_bj,drewfaulk,2018-04-21,1,Unconscionable Adulteration of a Perfect Product,8,2,"I check back every year or so to see if B&J has listened to their customers and gone back to the original Coffee Heath Bar Crunch recipe, but see they’re sticking to their guns on this one. This product used to be perfect and now doesn’t even taste like a treat. I’m shocked that the company would settle for this nothing-like-the-product-it-replaced substitute. Why would non-GMO and fair trade make it taste so much worse? Ben and Jerry’s are in the wonderful position to effect change by CREATING DEMAND for non-GMO and responsibly-sourced ingredients by showing how wonderful they can be: this does the exact opposite and actually hurts their cause. Dumbest business move since New Coke. After 4 years of hoping and waiting, I’m giving up on hope they’ll ever see the light or listen to their customers; This was my last appeal."
24_bj,Michael,2017-10-10,1,Go To The Graveyard Already!,6,1,"After being a huge fan of the CHBC, I was quite upset when the new flavor came out and still am. The coffee ice cream and toffee bar is absolutely disgusting. The toffee doesn't have the flavor that Heath Bar or Skor does, and the coffee ice cream is also horrible. I asked somebody else to try this flavor after it changed and they also thought it was disgusting."
24_bj,NickW2,2017-05-20,1,Awful...,7,0,"Since they don't sell regular coffee by the pint, I used to settle for Heath Bar Crunch. The contract must have expired and they replaced it with some awful generic.
Coffee is still good, toffee is inedible."
24_bj,ToffeeSlag,2019-09-19,2,Nope. This Ain't It.,1,0,"So today I tried B&J's Coffee Toffee Bar Crunch for the first time two different ways (as is my custom): very firm straight out of the freezer and slightly softened after having sat out a bit. I give this flavor a ""meh"" out of five. The large toffee bar chunks, purportedly fudge covered [shrugging emoji], don't do justice to the coffee ice cream. For me the pinnacle of grocery store coffee ice cream is Trader Joe's Brownie Coffee Crisp ice cream sandwiches. If Ben & Jerry's can pint up their version of somethingverysimilartothat, I will probably bankrupt myself when I find it in stores! That combo of soft brownie, small, solid chocolate bites and coffee ice cream is my jam. But toffee slag? Not so much."
24_bj,Pamela56,2020-01-30,5,It says what it is. Great title,2,1,This is my favorite Ben & Jerry's flavor. I have had trouble finding it in my location 65109 and 65101. I love the coffee flavor with the flavor of the heath bar and the crunch of this ice cream. I am gluten free and so may flavors have cookie dough which automatically eliminates those options. Love this ice cream. Please start delivering this back to the zip code locations of 65101 and 65109. I have not been able to find this flavor in Jefferson City. Miss this ice cream which is what prompted me to make this review. Love the ice cream flavor of Coffee Toffee Bar Crunch.
24_bj,Juliennes,2018-02-27,1,What a disappointment....,4,2,"I don't eat a lot of ice cream in order to try and avoid too much sugar. But I wanted a treat and Coffee Heath Bar has always been my favorite ice cream. I picked up a pint and was so looking forward to the indulgence. What an absolute disappointment it was. I originally thought it was me...maybe I had dreamed it up in my head that it had tasted better than it did in reality. I had some more the next day and it still was not good. I had my son try some and he agreed. I was not going crazy. The toffee pieces are just awful. I am all for the non-GMO movement but honest to God, I would gladly take the Heath Bars back regardless. It was a delicious treat that is now a huge let down. I truly hope that I can find some replacement :("
24_bj,Dave P WA,2018-08-20,1,non-GMO isn't really science,10,1,"Wow, eliminating my favorite ice cream for this dreadful concoction for completely non-scientific pseudo-science mumbo jumbo fakery reasons is just stupid."
24_bj,RichardA,2019-02-24,1,Bring back the Heath Bar!,6,0,This is very disappointing stuff. I'm sure that the company that makes this tasteless toffee is very happy to have actually found someone to buy it. What's next...Phish Food with actual fish?
24_bj,RaeU7916,2019-05-13,5,Oh me goodness!!,2,2,Saw this little guy in the freezer section and thought to my self my two favorite things so why now try it?! Got home and had a bit and it rocked my world. This flavor is amazing!! Delicious notes of coffee and massive chunks of toffee!! Pure delicious bliss for me. I went back and bought two more!!!
24_bj,Madelyn,2018-10-09,1,Yuck!,2,0,"I wish I had read the reviews, this ice cream is digusting! I love Ben and Jerry’s and like to try new flavors but this was a huge let down. The ice cream has little flavor and the toffee is indescribably bad. Like other reviewers said it tastes metallic and like a sugar free candy. The texture is grainy unlike other Ben and Jerry’s ice creams. I was wondering if I got a weird pint until I read the other reviews. I threw the pint away it, it was inedible. I expect more from Ben and Jerry’s especially at $5/pint."
24_bj,Andrew P,2019-01-04,1,Metallic taste still there,2,0,"It’s really not hard to make great-tasting buttery toffee candy. I used to do it all the time in my own kitchen, and I liked mine just as much as I like Heath bars. Please find a supplier of non-GMO toffee that doesn’t taste like a nickel-cadmium battery. Geez, maybe I’ll start up my own toffee company and underbid whomever you’ve contracted with just to save my formerly favorite ice cream flavor. (Well, second favorite of all time after Dastardly Mash — yeah, I go back that far.)"
24_bj,Susan,2019-06-04,5,Delicious,13,5,"This is my favourite flavour of Ben and Jerry's. The contrast between the rich coffee ice cream and the sweet crunchy toffee is lovely. My two main grocery stores appear to have stopped carrying it, and that makes me very sad. (I found this site because I was searching to see if Ben and Jerry's had discontinued it.)"
24_bj,SarahBucky,2018-05-20,1,Terrible!,3,0,"Would have given it zero stars, if possible! This flavor is awful! The toffee is terrible! I could and do make better toffee in my kitchen. This was a bottomline decision. GMO, Fair Trade blah...blah, blah...blah, blah. Ruining one of the best BnJ's flavors was a bottomline decision by the parent company, Unilever. If BnJ's was purchased by Hershey, Heath bars would still be in use."
24_bj,Theresa,2018-10-07,1,Sucks,4,0,I used to love your coffee heath bar ice cream. But then you took away the heath and put in cheap toffee. Yuck!!! You totally ruined my once favorite ice cream by getting rid of heath for cheap toffee. Now I will NEVER by any Ben & Jerry's ice cream.
24_bj,Jfer,2017-06-04,1,Do not like new toffee bar,4,0,"I have tried the new blend of coffee toffee twice and the toffee is disgusting. Coffee heath bar crunch use to be my favorite flavor, but I cannot even chew the new toffee without gagging."
24_bj,Kathy1950,2018-08-26,1,Horrible replacement!,4,0,Miss the full flavor heath bar and the big pieces. This is way off the mark leaving a nasty bitter taste from both the coffee ice cream and the toffee pieces. Will never buy this again.
24_bj,Mik123,2020-02-27,1,Lost a long-time customer,1,1,"Coffee Heath Bar Crunch was one of my favorite indulgences ever since I started eating ice cream as a kid. Upon trying this changed version, I was so repulsed by the new toffee that I feel like I can no buy B&J's in the hopes that hear us on this particular flavor. I can at some level understand switching away from Heath Bars but there's plenty of ways to get a decent tasting non-Heath substitute (I've had a lot of good toffee in my time). But with this version it's like they're trying to make the worst toffee possible. B&J's product people please please please hear us!!! :("
24_bj,Pearson88,2018-09-09,1,Used to be my favorite,3,0,"Coffee Health Bar Crunch was my all time favorite ice cream. When I went. To get a pint and saw the name change I was confused, but figured maybe it was rebranding of some sort, but when I took it home and tried it I realized I was wrong. Honestly, the new toffee is gross and I couldn't even bring myself to eat t.f he pint. So disappointing!"
24_bj,MarkChana,2018-10-03,1,Bring back Heath,4,0,The new chocolate covered toffee pieces are terrible. They taste like ash. This was among my favorite flavors back when Heath bars were being used. Shame it fell so far.
24_bj,ConorC12,2017-05-18,1,Flavor,7,1,The ice cream wasn't even coffee flavored and the toffee pieces left a bad taste in my mouth
24_bj,Jo28,2018-08-30,5,Lip smacking,3,4,"My mum got this ice cream last week and we finished the whole thing in two days. The crunchy, crispy toffee pieces laced in fudge was heavenly. I just have to close my eyes and enjoy everytime a piece of toffee gets in my mouth. How this flavour got such low stars is something I would never understand in this lifetime. Mum’s a huge fan of coffee icecream and she just can’t stop raving about it. For sure this flavour is something we’ll keep coming back to. It’s like the gold standard of all coffee icecreams that exist in this world. Thanks a ton B&J.❤️"
24_bj,RF144,2020-01-26,5,I really like it!,1,2,"I just discovered Coffee Toffee Bar Crunch recently. I usually stick to Cherry Garcia, New York Super Fudge Chunk, and Chocolate Chip Cookie Dough. But when I realized how much I love toffee, and saw this in the store, I thought I'd give it a try. I'm not a coffee drinker, but what the hey? Boy, I really like this ice cream! The toffee pieces are much bigger than I expected, and that's a plus! I read some reviews from people who enjoyed the Heath bar version, but not this one. I'm sorry they don't like it, but I think it tastes great. Thanks, Ben and Jerry and the ice cream team!"

24_bj,Wayne,2019-01-28,1,Changed formula??,5,1,"I was highly disappointed with the flavor, much different than the Heath Bar crunch my wife and I loved! We ate a few bites out of this pint and looked at each other the same way, like, what the heck did they do to our ice cream!!! Ugh!! By the way, what the heck DID you do to our ice cream!?!"
24_bj,efw63,2018-01-01,5,Love it!,5,1,"I hear that you may go back to the old recipe. If you do, I hope that you keep this one too! I love it! Some complain about the coffee being bitter, but it offsets the toffee perfectly. Love that toffee too! I have to make a special trip out of town to find it, but it's worth going after."
24_bj,ChelleS,2018-02-11,5,Love Love Love,4,0,This Ben & Jerry's flavor is dangerously delicious!!!
24_bj,CoffeeIceCreamLover,2018-02-23,5,YUM!,5,1,"I love coffee ice cream and this one did not disappoint! I found it creamy and delicious. There are other brands whose coffee leaves me with kind of a thick disgusting taste in my mouth, but not this one! It was absolutely yummy! As far as the crunch, that part was a nice treat."
24_bj,shannonCA,2018-06-19,5,Only one problem...,1,1,"Coffee Heath Bar Crunch was a magical concoction! Then it changed, and yes, it was gross and metallic for a while. But I have to say, it seems to have improved. It's not exactly the same as it used to be, but its much much better than the metallic one. I am 7 months pregnant now and it is 100% my biggest craving. Only one problem: I can never find it near me!!! The stores that are listed to carry this flavor never have it in stock, and now my poor husband is enslaved to finding it at all costs hahah! Please tell me how I can get my hands on a consistent supply!"
24_bj,Grandma Leslie,2018-03-08,5,Absolutely Delicious,3,0,"This is by far my favorite Ice Cream. I have a very poor appetite and even my doctors tell me I can eat as much ice cream as I want, I usually finish this in 2 sittings. The only problem is that my Giant Eagle runs out of it very quickly."
24_bj,Kjd313,2018-04-22,5,Definitely a favorite,5,4,"I love coffee ice cream, and toffee is my favorite type of candy, so this is obviously a winner for me. I've seen a lot of criticism about the toffee in this but I LOVE it. It's better than heath or skor in my opinion. It's much crunchier and it has more of a buttery taste. Every time I eat this ice cream I wish that I could buy the toffee itself to snack on, Maybe Ben & jerry's could start making candy too?!"
24_bj,COMtnMama,2018-04-10,5,Coffee & Toffee deliciousness,5,2,"This flavor is just so delightful. Robust coffee flavor tempered with the creaminess of ice cream, and crunchy toffee pieces, with bits of gooey goodness as you eat. It's really hard to get the right balance for a coffee ice cream, and somehow you found it! Such a great pairing with toffee! This Ben & Jerry's flavor I'll be returning to again and again!"
24_bj,Ezcarter04,2018-03-12,5,The single best ice cream in history,3,0,I try to be objective but it’s hard because this is the best freaking ice cream ever. Coffee toffee is amazing (and I’m a Mormon) and I will die if it gets discontinued.

24_bj,,2017-05-14,5,Amazing combination of flavors,4,1,"I bought this after coming back from a vacation where they had toffee ice cream and was looking for something to fill the void it left, and I'm so glad I did! This coffee is not over powering in its flavor, but is enough to make you taste it. The toffee is super crunchy and in big prices scattered throughout!"
24_bj,Former fan,2020-09-09,1,Still so disappointing,1,0,"Coffee Heath Bar used to be my absolute favorite ice cream and for years I bought it to the exclusion of everything else. Since the formula changed I've tried the ""new flavor"" (I get it, ""not a replacement"", sure) a few times and am always SO DISAPPOINTED. The toffee has a weird plastic-y texture and metallic aftertaste. This all natural non-GMO toffee tastes more fake than the good old Heath Bars ever did. And still missing is the absolute best part of the old flavor - the way the Heath Bars would melt a little into the ice cream leaving delicious gooey envelopes around the crunchy candy pieces. How long is B&J's Quality Assurance Team going to ""review"" all this negative feedback before they make a change? At least admit you aren't going to do anything, then I can just give up on it altogether."
24_bj,Bells,2020-03-12,5,My all time favorite,1,0,"Honestly, I was shocked when I saw how poorly this rates on the website compared to most of Ben and Jerry's other flavors! I too loved Coffee Heath Bar Crunch, but this is a totally different product and I love it just as much. If you love toffee and coffee flavors, I think you'll enjoy this pint as much as I do. Just don't go in expecting Heath! This toffee reminds me more of a rich, handcrafted chocolate-covered toffee bar you'd find at a local chocolatiers shop. And it is so dang good."
24_bj,poTATEogeek,2020-02-24,5,Underrated gem,2,0,"Yalls trippin if you think this ain’t the bomb. It’s got toffee, it’s got coffee, it’s smooth, creamy, has a great amount of toffee bits you can nibble on in between scoop sessions or you could save it for last. It doesn’t matter how you eat it it’s still one of the greatest ice cream creations ever to come out of a pint container and into your mouth."

Toffee is perfectly crisp and didn't get stuck in my teeth (I was a little worried about that going in). And I love the rich coffee flavor of the ice cream."
24_bj,Tammy75,2017-12-21,1,Awful!,3,0,Nothing like the previous flavor. Won't be buying this one anymore
24_bj,JacquiD,2017-07-17,5,Better than the old HeathBar one!,3,3,"The Heath bar crunch was my favorite flavor. After reading all the negative reviews, I was quite nervous about trying the toffee bar crunch. However, the new version is amazing! The coffee flavor of the ice cream is rich and deep, the toffee pieces are huge, and although they are not Heath bars, the Toffee is incredible. It does have a slight molasses taste to it, which is why I think people are saying that it tastes burnt. It doesn't! I am so glad they made my favorite flavor even better!"
24_bj,FuzzyGut,2018-10-02,2,Tough call,2,1,"I hate posting anything other than a glowing review of Ben and Jerry’s ice cream, but this... yeah. The coffee ice cream base is excellent, like all their coffee bases, but the toffee, while plentiful, is dreadful! I never had it with the Heath Bars so I can’t compare them; I can only go on this new pint I bought but the toffee is really terrible! I couldn’t eat it, not worth the calories. I bet it was glorious with the other toffee because the coffee ice cream is delicious."
24_bj,Kellbell,2020-06-27,5,My favorite!,1,0,"I tried this flavor my last month living in California and fell in love! It is the perfect amount of toffee and the coffee flavor is delicious. I never had the heath bar flavor that everyone seemed to love, but it makes me sad that everyone writes such poor reviews for this flavor. The poor reviews might make this flavor go away all together so please stop with the one stars! Since moving to Texas, I am completely unable to find this in any store in my area and am very sad."
24_bj,FormerBandJfan,2019-11-23,1,A terrible substitute for Coffee Heath Bar Crunch,2,0,Please bring back Coffee Heath Bar Crunch. This flavor is a dreadful substitute and has made me lose my love of Ben & Jerry’s. Coffee Heath Bar was my favorite. I can hardly believe that switching out to this other toffee candy could downgrade this ice cream so dramatically. Please bring back Coffee Heath Bar Crunch!
24_bj,Tarabara,2017-10-14,1,Sad,4,2,"I keep hoping b&j would listen to the feedback and change the recipe again, this used to be my absolute fave flavor but since they changed the recipe it’s no good. I haven’t met anyone who likes it now. So sad I’ll never have that delicious coffee heath bar crunch again.
Even if you can’t go back to original recipe, could you at least work on the current one and make it better??"
24_bj,Jeff,2017-05-30,1,What happened to Heath bar crunch,2,0,Just bought toffee bar crunch since I didn't see Heath bar crunch. Such a shame the new flavor was horrible compared to the original recipe. The vanilla ice cream was no longer thick and creamy and the toffee bar was terrible. No longer a Premium ice cream. Sorry B&J but I will not be buying anymore from you guys.
24_bj,Coffee Ice cream Fan,2020-06-29,4,I thought this was pretty good!,0,0,"Now, CCBBB is my favorite ice cream flavor of all time. Can this replace CCBBB? Not in a million years. However, the local stores in my area do not carry pints of it, and the nearest Ben and Jerry's scoop shop is an hour away. I was craving coffee-flavored ice cream one day and saw Ben and Jerry's was really one of the only brands that DO sell coffee ice cream. So I tried this. I think it was pretty dang good I just wish there was more crunch in it. If you have a coffee ice cream kick and can't get your hands on CCBBB, this is a solid alternative to crush your craving."

It took a bite or two before it actually got me and “Oh Wow!” I was hooked. This is the most amazing ice cream I have ever had, hands DOWN! I could eat it every day in place of my meals. It’s that good!"
24_bj,Rafi,2018-08-31,1,Ruined With The new Toffee,3,1,"When this was Coffee Heath bar Crunch it was my absolute favorite flavor ever. I ate almost a pint a week. Since switching away from actual Heath Bar, the flavor is incredibly disappointing. The off brand toffee supplier is pretty bad. There's so much good toffee in the world... I don't understand how B&J managed to find a bad one. The flavor is ruined."
24_bj,kiwisoup,2017-04-15,2,Not just the toffee bars have been changed.,3,1,"Used to eat this flavor all the time when it was Coffee Heath Bar Crunch. The coffee flavor ice cream barely tastes like coffee anymore. What did you do? Blech... tastes like watered-down stale coffee that was left on the burner too long. Usually I devour a pint, but this one has been sitting in the freezer for a week ahead I've tried eating it 3 times now."
24_bj,LizzyD,2019-01-09,1,Being back the Heath bars!,2,0,I was so excited to remember how much i used to love this ice cream (formally of the Heath Bar variety). Then I dug into this new version. SO disappointed. It really is gross. Totally different texture and flavor. Overly sweet but bitter at the same time. Ya’ll need to reassess
24_bj,Babar,2017-08-02,1,Disappointing,2,0,"I guess they've changed the recipe since I last had it, because I was just disappointed with what I got this time. It used to be my favorite flavor, but it was just bad, with a metallic tasting toffee . Hopefully they haven't changed the recipes for all their flavors."
24_bj,schottski,2018-05-18,1,Why does it taste metallicy??,2,1,We tried this flavor for the first time yesterday (both my husband and I are big coffee ice cream fans) and we both took one bite and spit it out because it tastes SO metallicy! Super weird. We made a friend try it too and she also agreed it tasted like metal. Not sure if an ingredient went bad or if it the recipe needs reworking but probably the grossest ice cream I have ever had. Stilll a huge Ben and Jerry's Fan but won't be buying this flavor again.
24_bj,DonnaPc,2018-02-18,5,Great taste!,4,1,"At first I didn’t like it. But then the flavors took hold of me and I absolutely loved it! It’s my favorite flavor. Unfortunately, it’s harder to find but it’s the best!"
24_bj,Nike,2019-11-24,1,Why mess up a good thing?,2,0,I kept thinking my taste buds had changed cause I haven’t had this ice cream in years but no the toffee and coffee are just bland and not at all worth the calories. Certainly a disappointment after having enjoyed the original perfection of coffee and Heath bars.
24_bj,Momtothree,2017-12-26,1,Wish you brought back the original!,4,2,"The old coffee heath bar was my go to ice cream! NOTHING compared. Went to buy it one day and I hoped it was just the name they changed but boy was I so disappointed that the flavor changed, unfortunately in the worse way! Never bought it again and keep hoping some day it will be back! Glad to see I am not the only one who feels this way!"
24_bj,Chant,2017-08-18,1,Horrible replacement,4,1,"I saw you changed out Heath bars for a non gmo version of toffee, unfortunately I absolutely hate this new flavor. Not sure it just tastes bland and off"
24_bj,Kristian,2018-10-12,1,"Do not buy, do not eat",2,1,I echo the comments of everyone else who is disappointed and frustrated by the change to the recipe. The new toffee bars are not crunchy and I don't like the taste. The ice cream has also lost its coffee flavor. This used to be my favorite flavor but no more. Why hasn't anything changef if you have passing along negative customer feedback for over a year? I'd rather you discontinue this flavor altogether than keep making it in its current formula.
24_bj,sdecker27,2017-08-15,5,This is my fav!,4,1,I love this one. It combines my favorite flavors of coffee and toffee.... enough said. Now PLEASE bring it back to my area!!! Thanks!

24_bj,CaliDreaming,2017-12-04,5,My Fave,2,1,"Sad to see so many foodies complaining about this flavor in comparison to a previous similar flavor. I do love that the chocolate and toffee texture is not frozen rock hard so I am able to enjoy flavor as it melts in mouth. I’ve been looking for a similar quality in a regular candy bars, no longer enjoying some toffee bars I’ve eaten before. Makes me wonder how delicious this heath bar flavor was to cause such an uproar from others."
24_bj,Farrinna64,2019-10-08,1,I haven't had Ben & Jerry's since...,1,0,"The last time I had B&Js, I thought I was buying my favorite flavor ""Coffee Heath Bar Crunch"". I wasnt paying attention to the change on the label. Starting to eat it and it didn't seem the same. I thought, maybe my taste buds had changed, or something. But, then I read the label and realized why. I haven't had B&J since. Now I'm reading these reviews, and it's not just me. Boy, do I miss my favorite ice cream, well ice cream flavor"
24_bj,Ciara,2018-04-08,5,My go to,4,2,My favorite flavor. Nothing can compare. I probably eat one a week. I was concerned with some of the lower ratings last year before I left for basic training that I would get out and it would be in the flavor graveyard. Lo and behold it’s still here. Can’t get enough of the toffee!
24_bj,Alw13,2018-03-29,5,Best best best ice cream ever!!,3,1,My MOST FAVORITE ice cream!! Did liked the 'heath bar crunch better but now that I'm used to this...I love it as We'll! The only problem is slowly but surely all my stores are dropping it..:-( There is only ONE Target that I know of that still carries it and it's 25 min away.
24_bj,Josh VT,2018-04-02,1,Skim Milk and Coconut Oil,2,1,"I do not recommend this product. Should not even be considered ice cream. The minute you added coconut oil it tastes chalky, metalic and poor texture. Also skim milk; why? This new product has more calories than the original version. Personally, when I choose this brand I expect true ice cream and ingredients. I do not care about how many calories or healther dietary ingredients. Make it the way it should be..."
24_bj,LibbyM,2018-07-21,2,Please bring back HEATH!!!,2,0,This is just not what it used to be. It has looonggg been my favorite flavor but the new toffee bar makes it a no-go for me. So freakin sad about it.
24_bj,Amklush,2020-02-16,5,Best coffee ice cream and toffee is amazing combo!,2,0,This ice cream I was worried wasnt going to meet my expectations...but it did! And the size of the toffee pieces were great! This combo is amazing!!
24_bj,JamieB,2020-01-25,2,Bring back Heath Bar,2,0,This used to be our family favorite. We bought a pint almost weekly. But we haven't bought it in a few years. It's just not the same anymore. :(
24_bj,Jess,2017-07-02,5,Blissful,3,1,I feel like this flavor was made for me! I was astonished when I found it. I didn't realize other people like coffee and toffee too! I adore the toffee bar. Better than any I've had before! I'm eating it as we speak. Thank you! I also LOOOVE the big chunks!!!
24_bj,Anna,2018-01-19,2,Unreasonably large and mediocre toffee,2,2,"I miss the Heath bars for sure (I saw a response to one of the reviews saying that this wasn't meant to be a replacement, and people just aren't that dumb). But I could get over it, I still like the coffee flavor. But why are the toffee bar pieces so enormous? What am I supposed to do with an inch-long chunk of toffee in the middle of my ice cream? Chisel away at it with my spoon? Not a good experience, and it's happened in all of the last few pints I've bought."
24_bj,BabyDaddy,2020-08-11,1,Pregnant wife is upset,1,0,"My wife loved the original flavor. She always said, whens she's pregnant she is going to eat this all the time. Well she got pregnant and there was no more coffee heath bar crunch. It crushed her spirits. Thankfully our local ice cream shop supported us through the pregnancy but the business would have been given to Ben and Jerry. Please bring back the CHBC flavor before we go through another pregnancy."
24_bj,rockinbaker,2020-06-22,5,Favorite Flavor,1,0,"This is my absolute favorite Ben & Jerry's flavor! I used to get it all the time, but the stores I went to frequently all stopped carrying it around the same time. I assumed it was discontinued. Imagine my surprise when I moved to NC, and there are actual Ben & Jerry's shops, and this flavor still exists! So excited to get Coffee Toffee Bar Crunch again after years of flavors that just weren't the same."
24_bj,Brenda,2017-11-01,1,Not good,1,0,"I was very disappointed after eating the new version of the toffey coffee heath ice cream. It was by far the worst I've ever eaten. The ice cream with the heath bar in it is my favorite. I will no longer buy it due to the drastic flavor of the new toffee. Most people aren't buying ice cream at Ben and Jerry prices for their health, it's usually to indulge a little bit. So sad to see the change."
24_bj,The flying sergeant,2017-05-24,1,My life's blood ruined,4,2,"Ben & Jerry's Coffee Heathbar crunch has been my favorite food of all for about 26 years. I no kidding had days where it was all i ate. When i was a paramedic in Williamsburg, VA there was a B&J's store where you made the best even better by being in sundae form, heaven it was! In the military, anywhere in the world I was if I could find some of this ice cream I felt at home. Now however, it's not the same. The removal of actual heath bars completely changed the taste. Gone are the treasure which was the little gooey pockets found next to a piece of Heath. I hate to say it, but it actually tastes bad. Didn't know it was possible for a B&J ice cream to taste bad but it does. The chocolate tastes cheap like cheap generic store brand and the toffee tastes & feels stale."
24_bj,Cricket68,2017-07-05,1,July 4th bummer,2,1,I always buy coffee ice cream. I usually buy a pint of coffee/toffee at the nearby coop. The price is 9.99. My husband treated me to your Coffee a Toffee Crunch. The ice cream tasted like molasses. The toffee bits had no crunch and tasted stale. I tried it twice thinking I ate something earlier that would alter the taste. Second spoonful hours later still tasted like molasses.
24_bj,jesslu,2017-07-25,5,Favorite Ice Cream...and I eat a lot of ice cream.,3,1,I'm shocked by the reviews of this ice cream. It's not the strongest coffee flavored I've ever had but when paired with the delicious and generously sized pieces of toffee it is fabulous.
24_bj,Patti,2017-06-20,5,Dad's favorite,3,1,This was my dad's favorite and I like it a lot too. He walked me down the aisle for my wedding in 1996 and his reward was a pint. I can't believe people aren't reviewing it higher.
24_bj,Bonne,2017-06-28,5,Awesome!,3,1,I love this ice-cream!! I'm from Canada and it also appears that my fav grocery stores have stopped stocking this one. I hope it hasn't been discontinued in the Great White North.
24_bj,Rufus,2018-11-15,1,Toffee pieces too large,1,0,"I like coffee ice cream. I like toffee. What could go wrong?? Ahh! That's right. The toffee pieces are too large, so large it's difficult to get a little toffee and a little coffee ice cream in the same bite. Too bad because toffee & and coffee go together like two peas in a pod."
24_bj,CTisthebest,2017-10-05,5,My favorite!,3,2,All the negative reviews are crazy. This is my favorite flavor by far! I love the giant chunks or crunchy toffee. No other ice cream maker has anything even remotely close. You're lucky if you get tiny slivers in other brands. My only regret is that it seems to be caffeinated so I can't eat it too late or it keeps me awake.
24_bj,Allieb,2018-03-26,5,BEST FLAVOR,3,1,Hands down the absolute best flavor made! No other coffee flavor even comes close! The toffee chunks are HUGE and the coffee flavor itself can’t be beat!!!
24_bj,maerceci,2018-04-15,5,Surprisingly Awesome!,2,1,"I wasn't too sure on this flavor, but my local store at them BOGO half off, so since they were sold out on Strawberry Cheesecake, I though I would try something new. And I found it to be one of my new favorite flavors. I love that the toffee doesn't get stuck in your teeth like a regular toffee candy bar, and the coffee ice cream compliments it perfectly."
24_bj,Jaze,2020-02-11,5,Best Ice Cream I EVER Had!,1,0,"This is the only ice cream im willing to eat. For everyone that doesnt like this ice cream your negative reviews has made it difficult for people like me who would like to find it at the grocery store. im on a ben and jerrys coffee heath bar crunch ice cream hunt and i cant find it. The gas station nearby was the only place i could find it for 6.99 and now they have discontinued it After reading these negative reviews now i see why its slowly disappearing from stores. it is absolutely the best ice cream on the market. my 2 favorite things combined coffee and heath make it easily my favorite ice cream. I would pay $100 to have a bucket in front of me right now, but it is like a mission to find it. i live by smiths in las vegas they dont have it, walmart doesnt have it, some albertsons may have it i think if im lucky but i havent seen it on this side of town since i moved. no ice cream compares to this one. i hope to find a store soon with it. <3"
24_bj,Julie11,2017-05-09,1,Not the best,3,2,"I thought I'd really enjoy this flavor, like I do with all other flavors or b&j, but this one just doesn't taste good. It leaves a bad taste in my mouth. I was excited to try it, but was very disappointed once I got home only to have it sitting in my freezer ever since."
24_bj,Kelly,2017-04-30,3,Just alright,2,1,I have always had a thing for this flavor and finding it around my area is hard. I recently stumbled upon it and was so excited to get home and take a bite. Not realizing they changed the heath bar to a toffy bar I knew something was different : (... I want the heath bar back!!! It's just not the same without it.
24_bj,Allie,2017-04-18,1,Disappointed,3,2,"I bought this one because I haven't been able to find my favorite Boom Chocolatta. I had high hopes for this flavor but the taste left much to be desired.
It's quite expensive to pay $6 for a pint and take one bite only to have it take up precious freezer space :("
24_bj,coffee craze,2020-05-11,5,I'm in love,1,0,I love this flavor ice-cream but it is so hard to find I know I might be one of the few that does enjoy it but I don't care i love coffee and the mix of the toffee and crunches it fills my sweet tooth I've even gone as far as ordering an entire case of this flavor for my family we all enjoy it on movie nights
24_bj,Bright08,2017-08-02,1,Yuck!,1,0,"This used to be my favorite flavor. I hadn't bought this product in a while and didn't realize till I bit into one of the toffee pieces that it was no longer made with Heath bars. I understand their reasoning behind changing the toffee pieces, but this toffee is horrible. Tasted old and very oily. So sad!"
24_bj,BJRCallahan,2019-10-10,1,"Once my wife’s favorite, now unpalatable.",1,0,My wife loved this back when it used Heath bars but now she cannot stand it. The toffee no longer compliments the whole. Thankfully Americone Dream is unchanged so she still has an option she enjoys. I understand this B&J goal but flavor is still the most important consideration when it comes to ice cream.
24_bj,Xonbear,2020-03-11,1,Horrible tasting toffee,1,1,"Bought it to try another one of the coffee flavors as cccbbb is one of my favorites and was thoroughly disappointed in the taste of this one.
The coffee flavor is a lot more subtle than cccbbb which isn't a bad thing, it's quite enjoyable; the toffee on the other hand is horrendous.
I have to sit with a bowl as I eat the pint to throw the toffee pieces into so I can enjoy the ice cream.
Will definitely go into my ""never touch again"" category."
24_bj,mary937630,2020-07-05,5,Absolutely love it!,1,0,"When I first tried this flavor I instantly fell in love! Coffee ice cream is one of my favorites, and the addition of the toffee brings it to another level. I have had some trouble finding this flavor in stores recently and I’m very disappointed that it doesn’t seem to be carried in a lot of places."
24_bj,Lilasiris,2020-05-21,5,Tastes great!,1,0,"This has always been my favorite flavor from Ben & Jerry’s, but it’s hard to find. I enjoyed it with Heath, but this new toffee is much better! It’s more buttery and easier to eat frozen. It tastes like the more expensive English toffee they sell in tins during Christmas."
24_bj,Erica,2018-04-22,2,Dislike the new recipie ...,2,1,This used to be one of my favorite flavors. Bought it today and didn't notice the name change. The bars have a gritty texture to them and is nothing like the Heath bars that were used. Disappointed. Really wish I didn't choose this flavor. Won't purchase again.
24_bj,Pepper,2020-01-23,1,Everything is a disappointment!,1,0,Are used to love CHBC far that I’ve changed wouldn’t be that different. Boy was I wrong! The coffee flavour is so disappointing and the bar is granny with no nice coffee flavour I am so sad as this used to be a big treat for me and now I’ve had to waste a pint.
24_bj,Rgdedge,2018-07-08,1,Ruined,0,0,"I’m so disappointed. I loved Coffee Heath Bar Crunch. I picked this up, assuming it was a slight retool with a new, generic, toffee bar. It’s just not good. The texture of the ice cream is icy, not creamy, and the toffee bars are crumbly and one-note: sickly sweet. They remind me a bit of Scottish tablet. 3/4 of a pint still in the freezer and I don’t think I’ll be finishing it. I should’ve known...same disappointment when Mint Oreo changed to Mint “Cookie”. The essence gets lost in the translation."
24_bj,Mom of four,2018-11-04,1,Terrible substitute,1,0,This is the worst thing you could have done to my most favorite flavor of ice cream ever!! This version doesn’t even come close in comparison to Coffee Heath Bar Crunch!!! Please bring back the original...this Coffee Toffee Bar Crunch stuff is awful!!!
24_bj,Pixie,2017-07-01,5,CoffeeToffeeBestComboEver! - SorryPB&chocolate!,2,1,I found this flavor many years ago when it had Health Bar and I was sad at first when the toffee changed but I have learned to love the responsibly sourced toffee too. I like to try other B&J flavors but Coffee Toffee Bar Crunch is my true love!
24_bj,Shay04,2017-05-14,1,Used to be good,1,0,This used to be my favorite ice cream. I keep buying more to see if it will taste the way it used to but ever time I'm left feeling disappointed and sorry I wasted my money. It's weird how something that used to be so yummy is now weird tasting?
24_bj,A1149TKR,2018-06-26,1,Heath Bar crunch,1,0,"I have been on a diet for a while, used my cheat day to share some ice cream with my partner. The “candy” you used to replace the Heath toffee is NASTY, what good is fair trade non gmo terd nuggets, absolutely the last time I buy Ben and Jerry’s"
24_bj,hmtj,2019-06-17,1,Toffe is horrible,1,0,Just tried this in desperation looking for my Coffee Heath Bar Crunch fix. What a mistake. The toffee is chalky. Horrible flavor. Can't compare to the Heath Bars they used before. Don't waste your money. Grab another flavor.
24_bj,Lori,2017-05-28,2,Different Toffee Bars,1,1,"My favorite Ben & Jerry's Ice Cream Flavor has always been Coffee Toffee Crunch, but the Toffee bars have changed. I think you used to use Heath Bars which are buttery and delicious and what a great combination to the coffee ice cream, but now the Toffee bars taste blah and I don't care for them in the ice cream. It makes the ice cream taste watery instead of buttery. Wish you would go back to the original recipe."
24_bj,steph22002,2017-09-18,1,Bad taste,1,0,i bought this flavor ice cream today. Its my first buy from the brand. I was ready to dig in. I was disappointed at the flavor. The coffee taste watered down. Not a rich flavor. The toffee taste odd. I didn't enjoy it.
24_bj,BJLUVER,2017-06-14,4,Good ice cream with a bad wrap,1,3,"Now I wanna clear some things up here. This isn't a bad flavor but it seems as though it's getting a bad wrap. What a lot of people won't tell you about ice cream indulgence is that the mood/setting/amount you consume/way you consume all affect the experience. So let me start off by saying if you set out to finish the pint, you might not like this flavor, and that's fine, but just know you didn't enjoy this ice cream the way it was intended to be enjoyed. This is for the people who enjoy small servings of sweets. For those with more mature palettes. This ice cream deserves appreciation and admiration, and I believe the consumer but question where they're at mentally and spiritually before imbibing. Are there better flavors? Of course. But it's all about the time, place, feeling, and mode/way of consumption. This is enjoyable."
24_bj,SSue12,2017-09-03,2,It used to be amazing,1,1,I bought this about 1-2 years ago under the Coffee Toffee Bar Crunch name. It had pools of the tasty toffee throughout and the crunch bars also had lots of the gooey stuff. The coffee base was smooth and rich.
24_bj,Toni94,2017-06-21,1,Used to be my favorite flavor. Now it's... ew,1,0,"When it was the coffeee Heath bar crunch it was absolutely stellar, but once they changed it, its really not good. It's the toffee. It's gritty, hard, and bitter which is a shame because the actual ice cream is good."
24_bj,Bill,2017-10-27,1,Threw it out,1,0,I just purchased recently and first time ever trying Ben and Jerry because a co-worker highly recommended and i took about 3 bites and threw it out. It was bad. Doesn't taste anything like what I was expecting.
24_bj,Fredwina D,2018-04-22,1,An abomination,2,1,"Coffee Heath Bar Crunch was my favorite ice cream of all time. You destroyed it. The ""toffee"" is disgusting and crumbly, and the ice cream is flavorless. I don't even buy Ben and Jerry's anymore. So sad."
24_bj,GramZilla12,2017-06-29,1,Not even close to the original Heath Bar Toffee,3,2,The newer version is a sad imitation of the original. New toffee is not even close to the flavor of the Heath toffee
24_bj,Chicky,2019-11-18,1,Not worth it!,1,0,"I tried this after they stopped using Heath. It's terrible! I was so unhappy, I've stopped buying all B&J products. I can appreciate they are trying to improve the products, taste can't be sacrificed."
24_bj,Ice cream machine,2018-07-24,1,Greatest Canadian Loss,1,0,I'm not sure I have ever been so sad as when this flavour was removed from Canadian shelves. It is my favourite flavour but I can't travel to the US just for ice cream. A nation has been deprived.
24_bj,nope,2017-04-27,1,Not Good...,3,2,"I bought this on sale, and I see why. The bars are good, but the ice cream was the worst B&J's i've ever had."
24_bj,MarkC,2018-03-28,1,So Disappointed,2,1,"I just tried what I was hoping was still my favorite B&J flavor. What have you done? You are creating anti-non-GMO consumers. If avoiding GMO means substandard substitutes, No thank you."
24_bj,Mom2017,2017-05-01,2,Don't like the new toffee,2,1,I loved coffee Heath bar crunch but this new flavor is nothing like it. Toffee tastes bad and barely a coffee flavor to the ice cream. I'll probably toss it out. Liked the old flavor better.
24_bj,AnonyfromWI,2018-03-22,4,I like it,1,0,"Not sure why so many blistering reviews, it's not even as horrible as it's being portrayed. I love the coffee and toffee taste. I enjoy ice cream every now and then and B&J's is a good brand."
24_bj,HANNAH,2017-05-17,1,Massachusetts,2,1,I feel so sick after eating this .. I have tree but allergies and I feel like my throat is closing after eating this.... i am freaking out . This was my fav flavor but what happened ?!?
24_bj,Hopup123,2017-12-26,1,Agree w neg reviews...,2,1,The toffee choc pieces are tasteless and the coffee ice cream which used to be rich and intensely coffee is more like tea and instead of creamy is frosty-iced pcrystalline. Very sad...
24_bj,Linz,2020-06-04,5,The toffee is perfect!,1,0,I don’t understand all these 1 star reviews! This is the absolute best ice cream and the actual toffee is far better in quality and taste then a Hershey's toffee bar. Perfection!!
24_bj,Donna,2017-06-23,5,Delicious Toffee!,2,1,I love my coffee ice cream. And the LARGE chunks of toffee in this provide a perfect crunch without being too hard. I appreciate the size and quality of the toffee. Brilliant.
24_bj,Ceci,2020-02-06,5,Favourite Flavour,1,0,"I love this flavour, it is my favourite! I think this is almost as good as it was with the original Heath Bar and appreciate Ben&Jerry's commitment and them being consequent."
24_bj,Jen Berry,2020-05-12,5,Coffee! Toffee!,1,0,One of my favorites! The reason for replacing the Heath™ bar pieces was in honor of Heath Ledger's tragic passing #RIPHeath...The people rating it a 1 Star need Jesus!
24_bj,Tmigs,2019-06-09,2,Ruined,1,0,"Was once one of the greats, but the toffee bars in this ice cream are no where near as good as the old heath bars were. Sorry; this one was t an improvement."
24_bj,Cathy84,2020-05-22,5,Chunks of chocolate covered toffee!!!,1,0,I purchased this along with my favorite core ice creams just to try it out. May want to have this as a shake in the morning instead of regular coffee.
24_bj,,2020-07-02,5,Love this!!!,1,0,Tried this flavor on a whim and I loved it!! If you like Heath or Scor candy bars you’ll love this. There a huge chunks of toffee. Sooo good!!!!
24_bj,Lanh,2020-09-10,5,Love this flavor!!,1,0,The coffee base is creamy and strong flavored and the toffee offers a delicious crunch. Also the perfect ratio of coffee ice cream to toffee!
24_bj,lovecoffeeheath,2018-11-19,4,Surprised at the number of complaints.,1,1,"This one is my favorite flavor from this brand. I used to love the coffee heath bar crunch as well, but to me, this one is so similar, I don't see why so many are disappointed? The toffee is probably a bit drier than the heath bar, but overall, I still love this flavor, in fact, I have not been seeing it as much as I used to at my local Target and I hope it hasn't been discontinued."
24_bj,Gamndalf the white,2018-06-24,2,not sure,1,0,"Not sure if I got bad pint or what, but the ice cream was icy and not creamy at all. the toffee was great!! ice cream more ice than cream."

24_bj,stevie9923,2018-05-02,1,Don't buy if you liked Coffee Heath Bar Crunch,1,1,"Stop saying this wasn't meant to replace Coffee Heath Bar Crunch. For customers who like Coffee Heath Bar Crunch, this is obviously what they will go to since CHBC is no longer available & the name is almost identical & only the only ice cream you offer with coffee & toffee bits. Most are obviously going to compare the two & this flavor simply does not taste as good as CHBC."
24_bj,Mikeybeee,2020-06-09,5,Two of my favorite things together,1,0,Never get rid of this flavor. Finally two of my favorite flavors and ingredients in one place!!!! Thank you
24_bj,,2017-09-28,5,This is my favorite flavor!,2,2,I loved Coffee Heath Bar Crunch and honestly I wasn't able to eat it for more than 2 years since I moved to another country. When I got back I saw the name change. I still love it and unfortunately can only buy the small pint size version. I would really enjoy a bigger size!

24_bj,TS ice cream,2019-09-12,5,My new favorite,1,0,Love the huge pieces of Heath Bar. Yummy! Coffee taste like a creamy latte. Great combination
24_bj,Sprowt,2017-06-09,5,Delicious!!!,2,1,The pieces of toffee bar are just killer. So yum! Might be my favorite coffee ice cream.
24_bj,Janebug,2018-07-13,1,Not quite up to par,1,0,The coffee flavor is washed out and the toffee is bland too. Sorry you diluted flavors!
24_bj,Jamboy,2019-04-22,1,Absolutely Terrible,0,0,"You guys really need to bring back the old flavor. The new one taste like metal and is disgusting. You discontinued your most popular flavor, who cares about gmos, you guys should be more focused on customer satisfaction instead of this PC garbage. Look at Amazon for example, they sell adult novelty items and whatever else and look where it has taken the company. This ice cream is trash and I refuse to buy Ben and Jerry's until you bring back coffee HEATH bar cruch."
24_bj,Tk224,2020-02-12,5,Amazing,1,0,Such a rich coffee flavor. So creamy and huge chunks of toffee

24_bj,Cath1234123,2018-05-30,1,Terrible!,1,0,I just spit this out of my mouth. The toffee is gross
24_bj,lynnie,2017-06-05,1,Terrible,1,1,"Coffee Heath Bar Crunch was my favorite flavor. The Coffee Toffee Bar Crunch is the worst. It has a gritty texture, not sure what that could be. The toffee is horrible. I checked the expiration date even because I thought maybe it had gone bad. Coffee taste is OK, but leaves sour milk aftertaste. I can't believe ice cream can be this terrible."
24_bj,Zach,2018-01-14,1,Unsatisifed,1,1,"I bought this ice cream flavor because I love toffee and coffee. I usually get americone dream but I thought it might be good to change it up a bit. Boy was I sadly disappointed. The ice cream almost had a smoky, burnt flavor to it and the toffee did not mix with the ice cream at all. I won’t be getting this one again."
24_bj,Smu1957,2020-03-22,1,coffee Heath Bar Crunch,1,1,I decided I wanted Coffee Heath Bar Crunch to help me get through quarantine for the coronavirus. Little did I know that B&J’s took away my favorite ice cream. I’m crushed...and apparently a lot of other people are too. Bring it back with Heath Bars no matter what you have to do with the company which makes Heath Bars.
24_bj,flocke,2017-10-06,1,As a Ben&Jerry's locker im just dissapointed,1,0,"Seeing this on my weekly shopping tour I grabbed expecting as always a delicious ice cream that I would enjoy with pleassure and a little guilt because I tend to eat the whole Pint in one sitting. Added to that I love everything coffee flavored and Toffee just reminds me of good childhood memories.
But this 5$ ""treat"" certainly did not remind me of anything remotly good. I did let the Ice cream get meldet a little and grabbed my spoon and wanted to indulge in. The pure coffe ice cream was passable , a little bit stronger would have been better in my opinion but hey everyones taste is different. What i really was excited for was the Toffee crunch. I grabbed a big spoonfull and tasted a really really big disapointment. It tasted all mettalic and even bitter. I even tried another one because I could not believe it. This was the first time I ever had to throw away a nearly whole pint of Ice cream. Let alone this makes me sade . After that I looked up the flavour on this side ans saw that many other Ben&Jerry fans had the same experience.
To sum it all up I tried nearly all flavours and loved them all of course one more then the other but i would never reject an offer to eat one. But this Coffee Toffe Bar Crunch was not only a waste of my money but also a discourage for a huge supporter of the brand . Next time I'm gonna think about if I want to buy one of B&J's products or one of a other brand."
24_bj,jkafor,2018-04-25,2,Bummer - Not the same!,1,1,Not the same flavor I once knew and loved. This used to be one of my favorites of Ben & Jerrys but I was sadly dissappointed after recently purchasing the new variation. Nothing against good old Ben and Jerrys but I was truly bummed after not having had it in years and finally deciding to treat myself. :(
24_bj,hunnybear,2017-05-27,1,"Metallic, chemical, stain your mouth flavor",1,1,"I got this ice cream from my local publix, and upon first bite, I was horrified. The toffee had a strange flavor, metallic almost, and combined with the icecream, was not a great mix. After having eaten the truffle kerfufflei was very disappointed, and sad to throw away a pint of your ice cream"
24_bj,Dave RN,2017-08-07,1,What a difference !!,1,1,"The heath bar cofffee had disappeared from my store. I then saw this new coffee toffee crunch. I was so excited, I bought three pints, in fear this may disappear also. My excitement was cut short when I tried the first pint. It was not heath bar coffee. It was a sad day as it was my favorite."
24_bj,ic critic,2017-09-04,1,Poor substitute for old Coffee Heath Bar Crunch,1,2,Shame they replaced the old Coffee Heath Bar(TM) Crunch for this one. The combo of this version of the ice cream and these 'toffee bars' have poor flavor and terrible texture. NOTHING like the old coffee and Heath Bars in the older version. Shouldn't have messed with a good thing!
24_bj,Gina,2017-09-04,1,Disappointed,1,1,I buy Ben and Jerry's icecream all the time(usually chocolate fudge brownie). I was very disappointed with the flavor and texture of Coffee Toffee Bar Crunch. It wasn't worth eating and this is one of the first times I've ever been extremely dissatisfied with B&J's icecream. :-(
24_bj,AmiG,2018-11-03,5,Still the best,1,2,"Saw the poor ratings and had to write a review to get it back up because if this gets discontinued I would be so sad! B&J marketing/distribution/whatever team, please do not get rid of this flavor! Make it extra delicious or whatever you need to do to get your fan base back but make sure it can live in our freezers for a long, long time."
24_bj,trai,2018-03-12,2,Toffee Bar NOT WOW!,0,1,"Always love me a Ben & Jerry's Ice Cream, but this coffee toffee bar a kinda a disappointment. The toffee is crumbly and not so great tasting and is off putting to the delicious coffee ice cream. I would suggest if this flavour was redone, is to use skor bar or even just the skor toffee bits without the chocolate coating. I think the skor toffee and nuttiness will pair well with the delicious coffee ice cream."
24_bj,MaggieSTL,2019-09-20,5,My favorite for years!,1,1,"I’ve been enjoying this flavor since I was in grade school! I used to buy it all the time at the local corner store on the way home from school. I’ve been having the hardest time finding it at the grocery store now-a-days, but it’s still my favorite!"
24_bj,Chez36,2018-11-21,5,So so tasty,1,1,I love coffee and toffee ice cream and I love that Ben and Jerry’s have put them together. I am from uk and the toffee pieces taste like little Dime bars. By far my favourite ice cream flavour will be looking out for it all the time!
24_bj,jakeat1,2018-04-25,2,Ruined!,1,1,"I loved Coffee Heath Bar Crunch! The new toffee in this Ben & Jerry's ""Coffee Toffee Bar Crunch"" is so bad. Please just don't even try it. They gave up taste for a no GMO product. Why??? I am not eating ice cream for my health."
24_bj,Ducky,2018-05-03,1,Dry and chalky toffee bar,1,1,Loved the toffee coffee heath bar crunch. The new version is really bad. The toffee bars are dry and chalky with no taste. I have tried it a couple times hoping it was a fluke. I would rather have a plain coffee ice cream.
24_bj,AndyC,2019-02-06,5,Additive Flavor - Grows on you!!,0,2,"I (like many others) was a fan of the Heath Bar Crunch. When B&J switched, I investigated as thorough as a consumer could. I discovered it had something to do with the Hershey's corp, and B&J had to come up with a toffee tasting replacement. So I gave it a try. It took a few pints, but I grew to love Coffee-Toffee as much as the Heath Bar Crunch. Its a little different, but it is good in its own way. This is the only food I've ever found that I can eat once a day and never get tired of it. I've probably eaten about 4,000 pints of the Coffee-Toffee (on top of probably 2,000 pints of the Heath). Sometimes, I get a pint that doesn't have quite as much of the toffee candy in it, so I buy a bag of the Heath ""Bit-o-Brickle"" Cookie bits, and sprinkle some on top, and it supplements the toffee nicely. Sometimes, I sprinkle in some Heath bits regardless of how much toffee is in the pint. I can't help it."
24_bj,Tallie,2017-04-21,2,Lacking,1,1,Love Ben and jerry's ice cream but this particular flavor has an odd aftertaste the tofee bars in it were amazing and I seemed to dig for them since the ice cream wasn't that great.
24_bj,Franwindle,2018-04-16,1,Disgusting!,1,1,"It was disgusting. Please ban all coffee ice cream. No amount of toffee can save this ice cream. Seriously disappointed. The vanilla toffee crunch, however, is delicious."
24_bj,LilMil,2018-03-21,1,absolutely horrible!!!!,1,1,"Please please bring back Coffee or Vanilla Heath Bar Crunch ice cream. The new kind, coffee toffee crunch or whatever it is called, is horrendous.....just awful!!!!"
24_bj,Kenelli,2018-07-28,5,Delicious,1,1,My favorite ice cream by far! I never tried it with the heath bar so I can't compare it to that. I just hope this never goes anywhere..but my belly!
24_bj,Joan,2018-04-09,2,Use to love Coffee Heath Bar Crunch,1,1,I was so addicted to this ice cream it's not the same but can't even find it any longer. Please return my favorite flavor.
24_bj,,2018-01-02,5,Coffee Toffee Bar Crunch Rocks!,1,1,This has been my absolute favorite by far for years! Although I must admit I like to add a bit of caramel swirl to it...
24_bj,JDP1,2018-03-25,1,It’s like New Coke...,1,1,"I have a sweet tooth that demands satisfaction and my “go to” was Coffee HEATH BAR Crunch. Probably the best ice cream in the history of the world. Then for some unforeseen reason (ok, I know it’s to be a better Fair Trade Partner/non GMO...) they took perfection and threw it out the window."
24_bj,AndiKay44,2020-02-09,5,Best ice cream I’ve ever eaten,1,1,"I see so many folks complaining on here, but I don’t understand it. This ice cream is incredible! I am now wondering what I’ve been doing with my life in eating any other flavors. I love that this ice cream isn’t overly sweet and genuinely Tastes like coffee. I took a pint over to my friends home to make them all try this flavor, that’s how taken with it I was (they all loved it as well. Maybe not as fanatically as me...but what can I say, I’m passionate ).
I want to let you know I buy your ice cream because of your ethics behind your food. I know that a good majority of people rely on willful ignorance with their purchases, but you vote with your dollar, and I feel much better funding something I can stand behind. Yes, consumers have autonomy to choose for themselves, but suppliers also have a responsibility to provide options for people like myself who wish to have integrity behind their purchases. If you miss the heath bars so much, go out and buy one and put it into your ice cream. You have the freedom to do that. I’m going to be eating this ice cream for the rest of my life, and this should be brought to any Ouija board event So I can enjoy it in the after life as well"
24_bj,Rachelly,2019-09-22,5,Ohhh Coffee and Toffee! Oh my!,0,1,"Used to buy this on a regular basis and now it's not here in the Pasadena, TX area. I wanted this so bad that I settled for terrible other ice cream coffee brand (didn't want to use the correct name because it really was kinda horrible) and bought some Heath miniature bars. Oh well. Still not satisfied because I really want your product."
24_bj,Dakwar44,2017-09-10,5,Great flavor,1,1,My favorite of all Ben and Jerry's flavor. The heath chunks go well with the coffee.
24_bj,Janice,2017-08-31,5,Excellent!!!,1,1,My favorite flavor!! My go to flavor at the Ben & Jerry's Store or grocery store!
24_bj,fumisme,2020-05-23,1,How the mighty have fallen.,0,1,This used to be one of my favorite flavours. It was best when it had the original Heath bars in it. It was still acceptable when it had the Ben & Jerry's toffee bars. Now it just seems to have flat pieces of chocolate in it without any toffee at all. I just finished my last serving of this flavour. It isn't worth the calories or the cost.
24_bj,uvarianna,2018-07-30,5,Good change!,1,3,"I'm happy they changed the type of candy bar. It now has natural flavors instead of artificial flavors. They should continue to make those kinds of decisions. Ben and Jerry's should be as natural as possible. It is originally from VT, after all."
24_bj,Jazz mann,2017-05-18,5,My favorite,1,1,I was surprised by all the negative comments. I find this ice cream delicious

24_bj,cam0477,2017-09-22,1,Used to be my go to flavor,0,0,"The old coffe toffee heath bar crunch was my tried and true go to flavor!!! I loved it!!!! So I was bitterly disappointed when it changed to non heath bars- not even comparable- but being a fair person I tried it again recently to see if maybe it would wear on me. Nope, sometimes a girl just wants some gmo's if it means better taste."

24_bj,Sparkles1970,2019-03-29,5,Best Ice Cream Ever!,0,0,I found this flavor twice where I live. It was the best ice cream I have ever had. I went to buy more and never found it. Still check the Walmart’s here every week. I would buy this ice cream on every shopping trip but have only gotten to eat it twice. I still want more 3 years later. I am actually sad that I can’t have any.
24_bj,Darrahh,2018-10-10,5,My New Favorite Ice Cream,1,2,I discovered Coffee Toffee Bar Crunch about 2 weeks ago and I simply cannot get enough of it. I told my bestie about it and she has been searching high and low for it.
24_bj,Emzy,2018-07-29,5,All Time Favorite,1,2,This ice cream brought me into the world of coffee flavored ice cream. I would be a worst person if I'd never discovered this truly fantastic flavor combo.
24_bj,Luthersez,2017-09-10,5,Number 1 in my heart!,1,2,"This has always been and continues to be my go to Ben & Jerry's! My only complaint is that occasionally the toffee bar chunks are too big, no big whoop."
24_bj,naneres,2019-10-26,5,By far the best ice cream ever,0,0,"I've loved this ice cream my whole life (38 years). It's so creamy and has the best coffee flavor. I love that Ben & Jerry's took the initiative to change their ingredients to non-GMO, Fairtrade, etc. More companies need to follow suite. I just wish this flavor was easier to find- almost no one carries it!"
24_bj,Cricket928,2018-01-20,1,Terrible without Heath Bar,0,1,I’ve tried really hard to like this new version but it just isn’t good. Please listen to your customers and bring back this ice cream with Heath bars. Your sales will make up for any licensing costs. And we don’t care about the sourcing mumbo jumbo. We want you to source your toffee bars from Hershey Co.
24_bj,kathyz,2018-10-26,5,Love it!,1,2,This is my favorite flavor! I love the mix of the coffee ice cream and the toffee pieces. And I love that the toffee bites are so big!
24_bj,CoffeeLover,2017-07-06,1,No long the same,0,0,"This used to be much better. I agree with all the other comments re the metallic taste. The only good thing is that it's no longer available in Canada - so I'm no longer tempted to buy it to see if the problem has gone away.
I still love B&J, but really need a good coffee version to be happy again."
24_bj,Kkely626,2019-01-26,5,DELIGHTFUL!,0,1,"I really hope Ben & Jerry's does not listen to all the whiners complaining that it isn't Heath Bar in the ice cream. Truly, this is my favorite flavor! The coffee ice cream is divine and the toffee pieces are delicious! There are usually some nice huge chunks of it in there as well. So so good!"
24_bj,sc123,2017-10-09,2,So sad!,0,0,"I love Ben & Gerry's....they have some really AWESOME flavors. But this is not one of them. So disappointing. I was totally expecting a delicious Heath Bar knock-off. But no such luck. The ice cream itself is the usual B&G's quality, but the toffee bar chunks are totally sub-par. wah. :("
24_bj,Angel,2020-07-01,1,Stop denying replacement,0,0,"Heath Bar obviously replaced by a salty concoction called toffee bar crunch. This used to be the only flavor I'd leave Haagen Dazs for. The coffee ice cream base still delicious, but I have to pick out all the big salty chunks of this horrible toffee. Perhaps add pecans or almonds instead."
24_bj,Mattyicekilla,2017-07-17,5,YOU EVER BEEN IN A STORM WALLY?,1,3,A storm of flavors blasting you in the mouth? When was a kid always ate the toffee heath bar and now it's there toffee I love it the same maybe more 5 star ice cream.
24_bj,Lolly,2017-09-20,1,Worst coffee ice cream,0,0,"I love coffee ice cream and I don't think I have ever hated it no matter which brand I bought, but this one was that bad. Major issue is the toffee bar pieces, they ruined the ice cream. Just get ride of this flavor for good. Brewed to Matter is really good though, that one I LOVE.."
24_bj,Frankie2u,2019-07-24,1,Chalky/gritty,0,0,"I bought this flavor this past weekend and it was chalky and gritty. I checked the sell by date and it doesn't expire until next year. Couldn't taste the toffee well either. I love your other flavors but this one let me down, especially it being close to 7 dollars a pint at 7-11."
24_bj,TRenee,2017-05-27,2,Disappointed,0,0,I LOVED the Coffee Heath! This toffee is not good to me in taste AND texture. The coffee ice cream is delicious though. I ate just the ice cream and tossed the candy in the garbage which was disappointing. I'm afraid to try other flavors that I like in case you changed them too!
24_bj,Jackpipe,2018-08-08,5,Can’t stop eating this!,1,2,Picked this up for the first time. It’s sooo good. I just kept eating and eating...
24_bj,MikeH,2017-07-28,1,So disappointing,0,0,"Coffee Heath Bar Crunch was the absolute best B&J flavor. The coffee ice cream is still the best, but the toffee bars in this pint have a kind of taste I can barely describe - probably because it doesn't belong. This flavor is not a consideration for me anymore. It is a shame."

I was sorely disappointed when I took a bite and got grainy ice cream. It was even worse when I found a piece of the promised toffee and it was mush, no crunch or nice toffee flavor just mush."
24_bj,RachelB85,2017-10-15,4,Needs more toffee!,0,1,"I grew up eating coffee heath bar crunch, and while I'm fine with this version, I wish there was more toffee. You get a few big squares in the middle, and then none for the rest of the container. Still delicious, just want more toffee. Nom nom nom."
24_bj,Busybee,2020-07-19,5,Always my favorite,0,0,This has been my favorite Ben & Jerry’s ice cream for years. I could care less if it has name brand heath bar or a different toffee candy bar. I still think it tastes the same. It’s delicious! Thank you for continuing to make this ice cream.
24_bj,Amby,2017-07-28,5,Sadly disappointed,0,2,"I expected the ice cream to taste like coffee coffee buzz buzz since they are both cofee ice cream. The ice cream tasted more like molasses than coffee. The toffee was disappointing also, it didn't taste like any toffee I've ever had before."
24_bj,,2017-09-25,1,No toffee in the ice cream?? 3 times...,0,0,I used to really like this flavor. But the last 3 pints have had literally 1 piece of toffee in them. Super disappointing.

24_bj,Debg,2020-06-03,1,Was my favorite until the change,0,1,I LOVED the coffee heath bar flavor. Was my favorite. But with the name change and the formula change it tastes like a cheap knock off. The toffee has a burnt taste. Very unappealing. Please find a different toffee to use.

24_bj,CRSpooner,2020-06-29,1,Why why why,0,0,I grew up eating Ben & Jerry’s coffee heath bar crunch ice cream. It literally was the only ice cream I would buy in stores. Years ago it was replaced by this terrible copycat.
24_bj,AnnaGarv,2020-03-21,1,Worst toffee ever,0,1,Wow what a waste of $6. I spent more time scooping around the cheap yucky toffee than I did eating the ice cream. Heath bars would have been much better. Gosh that was sad.
24_bj,jccd23,2019-04-15,1,Coffee Toffee Bar Crunch,0,1,It Was Any First Time Trying This Flavor And Overall I Loved The Flavor But It Was A Bit Hard To Enjoy Because There Was This Grity Powdery Texture To The Icecream Itself.
24_bj,LaurieUpstate20,2020-01-18,2,What Toffee?,0,0,I bought this a few days ago. Only two pieces of toffee in the whole container. And a few tiny pieces. Very disappointing. Maybe it was the last container in the batch.

24_bj,MalloryKnows,2018-05-10,5,For those who are brave or who have taste ONLY!,0,1,"I can’t even imagine comparing a nasty, trite, bland Heath bar to the fine, succulent toffee in this ice cream. A Heath bar belongs in a bland generic brownish ice cream made specifically for the commoners’ consumption, basically people who will never know any better; it certainly doesn’t belong in this delicious, palatable gourmet ice cream made by Ben and Jerry’s."
25_bj,Mama Shannon,2019-08-06,5,The best caramel ice cream I've ever haf!,3,2,"I tried this ice cream for the very first time about a month ago, and now it is my once a month treat to myself. I didn't eat ice cream very often, but I'm a bit of a caramel nut. When i saw this flavor, I have in and broke my rule and got a pint, even though I was leery of spending so much on an unfamiliar product. I have a strict budget, and only allow myself to get a ""comfort food"" treat once a month, so that I'm not tempted to buy junk food when I'm really in need of that ""comfort"" factor. I'm SO glad I took the chance! This is the best caramel ice cream i have ever had! My only regret is that out only comes in pint containers."
25_bj,BrianNYC,2020-07-30,5,Finally an ice(cream) caramel latte!,1,0,I bought this flavor a couple of weeks ago and it has now become my all time favorite ice cream! If you love coffee ice creams and caramel this is the perfect ice cream for you! Mixing the cold brew ice cream with sweet cream allows for a much more subtle coffee flavor and really emphasizes the trio of flavors goes together exceptionally well.
25_bj,goziii,2020-05-27,5,Rare Find!,1,0,"This ice cream is so good that I’m eating it right now. I love Ben & Jerry’s and I love coffee ice cream. So when I went looking for ice cream I went to the 7-11 down the street. Had I known this was going to be so good, I would’ve bought the rest of whatever they had in stock!"
25_bj,nikkibeethatsme,2020-07-29,5,"If you like coffee, this is for you!",1,0,"I absolutely love this flavor. We bought one pint and went back for two more, then we showed them to our friends and they went and bought some! The best flavor I’ve ever had."
25_bj,Dragonfire8910,2020-07-13,5,SO GOOD,1,0,"This is so good? I don’t usually like coffee icecream but this is amazing. Definitely has a lot of caffeine, but luckily I have adhd and am therefore immune."
25_bj,christianbean,2020-07-27,5,Best Caramel Ice cream EVER,1,0,Bought one last week at a 7/11 and saw that they’re exclusive so I had to go back yesterday stock up on a few!
25_bj,drewwwtimus,2020-09-22,5,Amazing & Satisfying!,0,0,"To say I love ice cream is an understatement. I eat a pint of Ben & Jerry's every night (that is not a typo). I usually do half baked and try other ""exclusive"" flavors when I need a change. I saw this flavor at 7-11 and decided to try it. Wow! This is my new favorite flavor! It tastes like genuine cold-brew coffee, not a cheap, overly sweet imitation. The sweet creme ice cream gives the perfect amount of sweetness without being too much. And the slightly salted caramel swirls are to die for. The combination of flavors is the perfect balance. It's not too sweet or heavy and is actually refreshing. There's no chunks, so if you love creamy ice cream like me give this flavor a try! Tastes just like that popular chain's caramel frappuccino. Only problem is that I bought every one at my 7-11 and can't find any more! I'm absolutely in love with and addicted to this flavor and hope it becomes a staple."
25_bj,Kosherjoe,2020-08-03,5,Best New B&J Flavor,0,0,"Dear Ben & Jerry or my life savers,
This is hands down the best icecream I've ever had. I had bought two pints and during quarantine these have been the best sweets. I had broken my arm so it's been hard for me to get around so when I postmates it no one can find me this flavor! So I went on the hunt for a day and after 10 different locations I could not find this flavor! Please make this a permanent flavor so I can have this sweet treat again!"
25_bj,Jmkbabe,2019-12-07,1,Disappointing,0,3,"I bought this tonight. I love Ben and Jerry’s, this flavor was the only one left at 7-11..... about four bites fixed my sweats craving, however- despite my love for coffee and my love for icecream - this just doesn’t taste quite right. Way too potent on the coffee side, and I like espresso straight. Not going to buy again :("
25_bj,JLNM,2019-06-18,5,Great Flavor,1,3,"so creamy and yummy, i love the chunks and swirls so much"
26_bj,Eileen,2018-01-22,1,Everything other than what it used to be!,26,3,"I have bought this flavor for years and it was my favorite ice cream EVER! However when you changed the recipe and took the HEATH out of it I noticed immediately! I thought I had bought a bad batch, and after a few bites threw it away. After 4 more batches with the same disgusting taste, I wondered why I was eating ice cream that tasted like rusty metal! And sure enough it was the NEW “Toffee Pieces”. They are so bad I can no longer eat this. What a tremendous disappointment. I could eat another brand of ice cream with a rusty spoon and it would taste less like metal than the New everything but the.....NEVER AGAIN!"
26_bj,DMAC,2019-06-01,4,"Love this flavor, but...",28,1,"This is my go-to choice every time I'm needing a fix. It's close to being perfection in a pint. However, I miss the Heath brand chocolate covered toffee pieces. It just hasn't been the same since the switch. Am I the only one that thinks the current toffee has almost a medicinal or metallic taste? Would love to see a better toffee choice in the future. That's not strong enough....PLEASE GIVE US BETTER TOFFEE PIECES!!!"
26_bj,Hrshanahan,2017-09-10,4,Where's the toffee?,4,0,"This flavor is one of my favorites! I fell in love with it the first time I had it, it was packed full of peanut butter cups and huge pieces of toffee. However the past couple time I've had it I only get shavings of toffee, and a couple peanut butter cups. was there a recipe change? Smaller toffee and more nuts? Fewer PB cups? I'll still purchase this flavor! Just disappointed to not find large toffee pieces and more delicious PB cups"
26_bj,Alanna P,2020-06-10,5,Delicious Flavors!,2,0,"I got this ice cream for the first time after finding out about Ben and Jerry's no nonsense stance agaisnt white supremacy and was not disappointed! Absolutely delicious, I ate every morsel I could get! The peanut butter cups were massive and delicious, the toffee pieces were really yummy for me, and the white chocolate was not overpowering, as white chocolate can sometimes be, but added a nice addition. I will certainly get this flavor again and am excited to try other flavors in the future!"
26_bj,Shan,2017-07-06,1,Where did Everything go?,6,3,"There is a complete lack of ""everything"" in this! I've had four in a row with no toffee, and very little of anything else. Seriously?? When you pay a premium for ice cream that is stingy, it is not premium, it is a waste of money! Very disappointed! Been a forever fan, but I'm done hoping it was a temporary issue, it has been consistently lacking. So sad, but time to say goodbye):"
26_bj,Elizabeth,2018-03-09,5,Awesome Except the Toffee,3,0,The toffee isn't nearly as good as when it used to have Heath bars in it - it tastes a little more sour to me. But everything else is fantastic. This is by far my favorite B&J flavor.
26_bj,FuzzyGut,2018-06-08,3,"Almost great, but misses",4,1,"Ben and Jerry’s is hands down my favorite brand! As for this flavor, the ice cream is great, as are the peanut butter cups, but the toffee is not good at all. I never had this when Heath was used but I can imagine it was far better. The nuts were ok but I won’t be buying this flavor again. Others are far better. Sorry, folks."
26_bj,may_g13,2018-09-18,1,Peanut butter cup overload,2,0,"This ice cream was practically taken over by pb cups. While I do love pb cups, I wanted more of a variety in this ice cream. I only got two pieces of the toffee and less than 5 almonds. The white chocolate was there which was delicious but my favorite is the toffee and unfortunately it was lacking. Overall, it’s good if you’re in the mood for peanut butter cups."
26_bj,Kokoabuttah,2020-07-14,4,Pregnant go to,0,0,I bought this ice cream honestly because the supermarket was having a sale and they didn’t have the kind I originally wanted no brand shall be named being that I’m 38 weeks pregnant and can never make my mind up on what I want the list of ingredients sounded like a delicious combination of everything I wanted to try so I bought one. I thought it was vanilla ice cream with chocolate swirls but it’s not its Chocolate and vanilla ice cream togetherI honestly don’t even like chocolate ice cream but to my surprise it was delicious!!!!! . I would love to see more pnutbutter cups in there but beside that it was amazing.Now I find my self going straight to this brand and this flavor no matter if it’s on sale or not.
26_bj,HorriblebooTM,2018-08-23,2,Um...,1,0,"So I just got this stuff from a local drug store because I’ve never had Ben and Jerry’s before. I was so excited to try it! Once I did, I had to spit it out in the sink. The chocolate, vanilla, and almonds are good, but the toffee covered fudge chunks tasted nothing like hoe they sound. They tasted like blood or rusty metal. Yuck! I thought I could just work my way around the blood tasting fudge pieces, but no, the metallic flavor was everywhere! Not getting this flavor again!"
26_bj,ColumbiaH,2018-11-11,1,Sounded good but tasted awful,4,1,"I have no idea what it was but randomly through eating it I’d get this terrible taste in my mouth. I came to read other reviews and someone else summed it up perfectly. The toffee tasted like rusty metal! great idea, but something in this is off."
26_bj,Shannon,2017-07-01,3,Everything but the Peanut Butter Cups,4,2,"I debated between this and Coffee Toffee Bar Crunch for quite a while but ultimately decided on this because of the Peanut Butter Cups, but there wasn't a single peanut butter cup, if you can believe it!? There was a very generous amount of large Toffee bars, which was nice, but it certainly did fulfill my Peanut butter craving. No hard feelings, just saying!"
26_bj,kleemargaret,2018-09-02,3,Not the Same,1,1,"5 years ago, Everything But The was my favorite treat. I ate a pint a week and I was in love. Then, one day, I opened a new pint of the ice cream and found that the Heath Bar part tasted a little funky. I thought at the time that I got a bad batch of the ice cream and bought a new one. Sadly, I realized that there had been a switch of the Heath Bar permanently. For the past 5 years, I have eaten around the metallic tasting toffee. I still love the flavor, but I beg that we can switch back to the original taste."
26_bj,prospermom,2019-04-05,3,Please use better TOFFEE!,1,0,"This was my favorite ice cream in the whole world (five stars!) UNTIL the ""new"" toffee. From the other reviews I read, I know your other fans agree with me. And of course this applies to all your other flavors that have Toffee as well, that I USED to enjoy, like Coffee Heath Bar. I appreciate the Non_GMO/Fairtrade efforts, but can you please source Toffee that meets your standards and actually tastes good? The toffee is missing the buttery taste. Or maybe gets Hershey's on board with making some special non GMO Toffee just for you guys? I used to love digging for ""treasure"": the gooey, slightly melted toffee pockets were my favorite part. Now, I don't buy this ice cream nearly as much as I used to, but when I do, I dig around the toffee and throw it away, which is wasteful. I cant just add Heath bars to this myself because they will not get those gooey carmelly toffee pockets."
26_bj,Specie,2019-09-29,2,What Happened??,1,0,"This was always my favorite flavor. Lately, though, the Heath Bar pieces and Peanut Butter Cups are few and far between. Like almost non-existent. Just some tiny round balls of chocolate with almonds inside (I think), and flat pieces of chocolate. Are the new owners cheaping out? Please bring back the original - it was one of the best ice creams on the planet!"
26_bj,Rmg1188,2019-08-19,3,Inconsistent,0,0,"When I crave ice cream this is what I crave. It's literally all of my favorite candies in one ice cream. But it's really hit or miss with the amount of candy in it. Sometimes I'm completely missing toffee pieces, or white chocolate pieces it just depends. There never seems to be a shortage of the peanut butter cup though. I just wish the candy ratio was more balanced and consistent. I literally never know what I'm gonna get when I buy this, but i still buy it anyway because even on its worst day it's still pretty darn good."
26_bj,karlena,2018-03-24,2,Everything But The Delicious,0,0,"I've never been disappointed with Ben and Jerry's in the few months I've been buying pints. I like to try a new flavor every time. The description of this flavor sounded to die for, so I snagged a pint. However, I'm very disappointed in the flavor of the candy chunks. The white ""fudge"" tastes like plastic or has some sort of chemical aftertaste and the toffee pieces taste metallic/rusty. The chocolate ice cream and the peanut butter cups are what enabled me to keep eating it and not throw it in the trash."
26_bj,pointeful,2017-05-29,5,Absolute favorite,1,0,"My mom bought this flavor my entire childhood and got me hooked on it! Everything in it works seamlessly and provides a different, sweet, chocolaty taste with every bite! The inclusion of the two kinds of ice cream makes it even better!"
26_bj,Douglas,2019-05-08,2,Used to be good,1,0,This was really good back when this had Heath toffee bars in it. Sadly this is not the case anymore. The new toffee bars are metallic tasting. On top of that all stores within 25 miles of me stopped carrying it. Might be the taste???
26_bj,Nikhug,2020-02-05,3,the loss of Heath,1,0,"Still a fan, but the loss of real Heath bar really downgraded the product. On my bookshelf I have an empty pint of the last container with real Heath bar in it, a happy reminder of a better time in a better product"

26_bj,Dianne,2018-06-17,5,Best flavor!,0,0,"This has been my ""go to"" flavor for years! It combines the best of everything (which means no cloying caramel)! I can never choose between chocolate and vanilla, so I don't need to with this flavor. I love the big peanut butter cup chunks, toffee pieces, and fudge covered almonds. These three items are my favorite mix-ins at any ice cream parlor. Most Ben & Jerry flavors are good, but this one is exceptional and 100% perfect."

And then I bought it and there was 3 PIECES OF PEANUT BUTTER LIKE WHAT. It was LITERALLY all Ice cream I was not happy. And the other things like the almonds and whatever that other thing is was so so and there wasn’t much of that either. Yea like this is just all I’ve cream.

However, I recently brought a pint the other day and there was no toffee whatsoever in my pint. How are the batches being made now? It seems like for the price you would literally get some of everything. I would appreciate better service."

27_bj,tortellini,2018-04-03,5,Delicious Swirls,3,0,The regular chocolate ice cream usually isn't the best but the salty pretzel swirly really elevates it to a new place. The combination creates a salted chocolate flavor that really keeps you coming back for more. Marshmallow swirls are always a good option over mini marshmallows and the almonds add a good crunch. I rounded this up to 5 stars but I would be interested in graham cracker or some type of pastry chunks along with or replacing the almonds. I just simply don't love almonds. Overall 4.5/5 Very good. Worth buying.
27_bj,Chip M,2019-05-16,5,"Love, love, LOVE Glampfire!!!",6,0,"I found this ice cream last year and bought way more than I should have over the summer and cleared out my local Target in the Fall. I mourned the loss of summer and this ice cream until I happened across five pints at that Target close to the holidays! It was a Christmas miracle that I savored well into the new year. Then it was gone...again. I thought that was it until I saw it today back on the shelves. THANK YOU, B&J for bringing this back. I hope this is a permanent summertime flavor!!! The salty/sweet combination is PERFECT!"

27_bj,tracymzuziak,2019-06-12,5,Best flavor EVER!,11,0,"I, myself, am not the biggest fan of ice cream, but I was stocking up for my husband, and I saw this exclusive flavor at Target. Got it home, tried it for myself, and went back the next day to get two more pints! I LOVE IT! The chocolate is so decadent. The marshmallow is scrumptious and the little bits of pretzel give it the perfect dash of crunch and salt. I cannot stop eating it. Dee-lish!"
27_bj,FuzzyGut,2018-06-27,3,"Good, not great.",11,11,"I think Ben and Jerry’s does the best chocolate and fudgie flavors I’ve ever had, and this one is now exception. The pretzels were great tasting and nicely salty but was not so much a swirl and more chunks of pretzel here and there. The marshmallow was great and played well with the pretzel chunks against the chocolate background but honestly, the fudge covered almonds were kinda gross tasting and I had to eat around them. The real problem was that the pint wasn’t full! There was a big gap on the side of the container and that was rather frustrating. This came so close to being great but between the missing ice cream and the funky almonds, I think this one time will be my last for this flavor."
27_bj,chefamyj,2020-05-13,4,Good not great,0,1,"I'd give this an 8 out of 10. The chocolate I good, and marshmallow swirl is awesome(which I love) and the chocolate covered almond chunks are fantastic. And it would be 10 out of 10 except the pretzel part is waaay too salty. if it were actual pretzel pieces it would be ok too But in the container I got, the pretzel part was like the texture of wet sand and just too salty. Zero crunch at all and no defined pieces. just this salty paste. But the chocolate, marshmallows and almonds are so good. I'm wondering If I got a bad container because reading other people's reviews of this flavor, they had pretzel pieces in theirs. which would have been 10x better."
27_bj,Carolyn,2018-04-23,5,Obsessed!,7,0,"I tried this on a whim, and it is now my absolute favorite flavor ever! The combination of chocolate ice cream with slightly salty pretzel bits and globs of gooey marshmallow along with fudge covered almonds is just perfect. Please let this be a regular flavor and not just a limited edition. Pretty, pretty please!"
27_bj,audrey1,2019-04-22,5,Please make this a permanent flavor!,5,0,"BEST FLAVOR EVER. The pretzel swirl is my favorite feature of any ice cream, and the fudge almonds are amazing with the salty pretzel. I was so disappointed when I stopped being able to find it in the store and really hope this flavor makes a comeback! I would make this a staple of my ice cream rotation :)"
27_bj,Angie Mottk,2019-04-25,3,I loved the first pint of this but...,1,2,"I bought this last month and feel in love! The salty swirls are so delicious and the marshmallow took the show! I would have given this a 5 out of 5 based on that. But purchasing it again, it was basically chocolate ice cream with marshmallow. The pretzel swirls was NOT in my pint. Very disappointed in the hit or miss with the pints. I thought they was improving on this but that’s the second pint of this flavor with the skimpy mix ins. I get so disappointed when this happens being I only indulge once a week in ice cream so I want it to be good! Please work on this."
27_bj,Charm,2020-05-24,5,Salty and sweet,0,0,On behalf of all pre menopausal women... don’t let this one go. Crunchy and salty and marshmallowey chocolatey goodness. Best pint of ice cream I’ve ever eaten.

This is the first ice cream that I haven't been able to put down and I must have ate it all, cause now I can't find it at any of the Targets.

27_bj,CurlyGF18,2019-03-03,5,BEST ICE CREAM EVER!!!,2,0,I adore all kinds of chocolate ice cream and have a special place in my heart for Ben and Jerry’s (its always just perfectly rich) but this flavor is bar none my favorite ice cream of all time!! It was a seasonal Target only flavor so at the end of the season I bought 9 to last me until next summer!!
27_bj,ChrisColby,2020-03-05,3,Rocky Road-ish?,1,0,"Glampfire Trail Mix has chocolate ice cream with chocolate covered almonds, a marsmallow swirl, and a pretzel swirl. The base and almonds provide alot of chocolate flavor that dominates the taste buds when eaten in isolation. The salty pretzel swirl gives a nice crunch and heightens the chocolate, giving it a sort of dark chocolate taste. It's a little overbearing but luckily the sweet marshmallow swirl balances the other components out, providing a great flavor when eaten as a whole. Very close in fact to a rocky road but done better. The only problem is the amount of marshmallow isn't enough. Perhaps I just got a pint with less marshmallow but without more of it, the salty chocolate taste can be overpowering. A great flavor when all the components come together but a little too strong on the chocolate taste otherwise."
27_bj,NanasCone,2019-09-15,5,Might be my new favorite!,1,0,"Just picked up this pint today, and was blown away by how deliciously rich, textured, and addictive this flavor is. I loved the chocolate covered almonds, the rich chocolate icecream, against the gooey marshmallow, and the nicely salty graham cracker. I am no fan of those cloyingly sweet salted caramels flavors, so I wondered if the salted graham crackers would work. It was perfect! This would be my icecream s’more of choice. Please make this a regular flavor!"
27_bj,IceCreamEnthusiast,2019-07-30,5,THE GREATEST ICE CREAM EVER,1,0,"As an avid ice cream enthusiast I’ve eaten my fair share of ice cream, but this flavor is hands down the greatest I’ve ever had. I stumbled upon it in summer 2018 and then spent an entire year searching for it at every store I went into for the last year. I just found it again and I bought the entire stock. PLEASE make this a permanent flavor! I never write reviews on anything.... but felt compelled to expressed my love for this amazing ice cream!"
27_bj,Natf,2018-03-23,5,Awesome Mix!,2,0,"If you like heavenly hash icecream, this is just about the same thing. The marshmallows are very creamy, and the hint of salt from the pretzels accents the chocolate and almonds perfectly. This might be my new favorite flavor! Thanks Ben & Jerry."
27_bj,margie,2019-01-28,5,cannot stop eating!,2,0,Awesome ice cream! The add-ins to this ice cream are just terrific. The marshmallows and pretzels. I cannot stop eating this flavor. I hope you keep it in the rotation!!

My favorite flavor before was Half Baked, but I took a bite of my son's pint of this Glampfire Trail Mix and honestly was MIND BLOWN! The saltiness of the pretzelness mixed with the sweetness of the marshmallow is PERFECT. The perfect texture and you won't be bored because there's always complex, changing flavors throughout! SO DELICIOUS! This is our new FAVORITE"
27_bj,SamanthaPN,2019-01-08,5,MY NEW FAVORITE,2,1,"This is the most perfect ice cream I have ever eaten. I can’t smell, so I love strong flavors, and this ticks every box. Sweet, salty, creamy, good textures - it’s like ambrosia. When I suspected Target was going to stop carrying it over the winter, I bought 20 pints from my local stores and boy am I glad I did. I’ve had one a week since then, and recently ran out. I PRAY that this comes back next year!!!"

27_bj,kyla,2020-05-07,5,The best flavor,1,0,"I have a lot of favorite ice cream flavors but this is the best one, by far. I am OBSESSED with it, and they stopped stocking it at my local stores as well as the big box stores in my town about a year ago. I'm super sad about it, and still scour the shelf every single time, hoping it'll come back. The combination of flavors in this one is just perfect, hasn't been matched."
27_bj,RockMomma,2019-06-04,5,The best flavor there ever was!,0,0,"Glampfire Trail Mix is literally the best flavor of all time. I can’t think of anything better than rich chocolate ice cream with a pleasant sweetness and then BAM- salty pretzel, gooey marshmallow, and crunchy almonds. My local Target stopped carrying it during the winter months, and then there it was in the freezer section the other day....my heart almost stopped. They brought it back for the summer!! I jumped for joy like a little kid and bought a bunch of them. Never stop making this flavor. It’s life changing!"
27_bj,RRatx,2019-06-09,5,My absolute favorite,1,0,I cannot believe this is not available everywhere!!!! I am a huge Ben and Jerry’s fan (like I get pints of B&Js instead of cake on my birthday).... this is my absolute favorite flavor! If I had a deep freezer I will just fill it with pints of Glampfire!
27_bj,Mdbenandjerry,2019-05-18,5,The pretzel swirl rocks my world,1,0,This flavor is so close to perfect. Only way it would be better is with more marshmallow and pretzel swirl. So GOOOOOD
27_bj,scoops,2018-03-26,3,Love the Pretzel Swirl But Mix-ins Few & Burried,0,0,This flavor has potential but needs better execution. The chocolate base is dark and goes well with the marshmallow swirl and pretzel swirl. There's some good texture with both swirls and a slight saltiness from the pretzel swirl.
27_bj,_jquig_,2019-07-02,5,Pretzel swirl is mind-blowing,0,0,"This flavor is now one of my top ice cream flavors of my life. The pretzel swirl is to die for, and the marshmallow swirl and almond chunks are a great addition. but really, that pretzel swirl is life. I hope it gets incorporated into more flavors! (In fact, a peanut butter world flavor with pretzel swirls might the best ice cream flavor I can imagine)."
27_bj,Stormy9679,2019-07-28,5,Absolutely amazing!,0,0,"If you’re a chocolate lover and enjoy the regular s’mores flavor you love this one! I knew when I read the ingredients that I’d love it. From the very first bite to the last, it’s a flavor that I’ll never forget. It’s the perfect blend of chocolaty sweet and a hint of salty that will send your taste buds on a journey"
27_bj,Carmella,2018-09-25,5,Best Flavor Ever,0,0,"I got this at Target and it was so amazing. I love ice cream and eat lots of it, and have tried many Ben and Jerry flavors. This was the best ice cream I ever had and my brother in-law agreed. Alas, I can't find it now and am heart broken. The lack of this flavor is driving me to try and make my own."
27_bj,Cawthorn,2018-04-17,5,Better than before,0,0,"I’ve been waiting for Ben and Jerry’s to bring back my favorite flavor. It was chocolate ice cream with marshmallow and Graham cracker swirls.
This flavor is even better. It has the rich chocolate ice cream. The gooey marshmallow swirls. Slightly salty pretzel swirl and crunchy almonds. Perfection."
27_bj,Icecreamfan4life,2018-06-20,2,Not Glamping Girl,1,1,"I bought this flavor from my local Target last week along with a couple of other flavors. Figuring that, since I've come across a couple really good chocolate ice creams lately, I can't go wrong, right? Most especially with this being a B&J's flavor. But unfortunately, I have to say that this one missed the mark for me. :( I mean don't get me wrong, I had all the mix-in's, in the right amounts. But personally speaking, I felt like this was kind of another visit to salt lick city round two(first trip was via the Salted Caramel core flavor a while back), when I hit that pretzel swirl. I mean if I didn't eat straight from the middle where the marshmallow was and some of the not so salted part of the pretzels bits were or strictly the base that was on the outside of the swirl. I was just totally bombarded with a bunch of salt from the main part of the pretzel swirl. And it was soooo not good. Add to that, I am not quite sure what kind of fudge was made or bought to coat the almonds. But I beg of you B&J's, please find a way to tweak the recipe, some how. As I thought eating a couple of those would offset the salty flavor as well. But nope, the taste of that particular fudge just was not very appetizing to me. I'd recommend the fudge that is used to make the fish in Phish Food. But definitely not this new recipe. Sorry."

27_bj,Chicksluvrock,2018-04-14,5,Addicting,0,0,This is definitely my new favorite Ben and Jerry’s flavor. The pretzel swirl has that perfect saltiness that is so addictive and pairs well with the chocolate ice cream. The fudge almonds add a nice crunch and the marshmallow brings it up a notch. Great job on this flavor! Love it very much!
27_bj,QueenofEverything,2018-06-23,5,Wow.,0,0,This is exactly what I was expecting! The chocolate isn't too overpowering or overly chocolatey and the pretzel swirl gives just the right amount of pretzel flavor with a hint of saltiness. The marshmallow swirl adds a nice touch.

28_bj,Derecia,2018-04-19,3,No brownie in my half baked pint ☹️,6,0,I bought me a pint of Ben and jerrys half baked last night at QT reading the description excited to try it mainly because of the brownie chunks but there wasn't any brownie it was mostly just chocolate and vanilla ice cream with hard balls of cookie dough. And I paid 6.99$ bummer
28_bj,Melody32,2019-09-16,3,Sadly the reports are true,0,0,I bought this ice cream because I was having a huge craving and I found that sadly the negative reports are all true. The brownie was a crusty and dried out consistency and the cookie dough was quite dry and chalky. I am still a fan of Ben and Jerry’s (I used to work there and I also appreciate their sincere care for humans and the environment) and I hope this flavor does get fixed because it’s a complete mess right now.
28_bj,will21,2017-07-14,4,Just not the same...,7,0,"I really tend to stay away from sweet stuff but once i tried this flavor of ice cream on an impulse buy, i've been hooked since. This has been my go-to snack for 2 years and its constantly stocked in my freezer. Unfortunately over the past couple of months i've noticed a degrade in the brownies. What was once a gooey,chewy delight, is now an odd,kind of crunchy (not in a good way), cake that crumbles in your mouth like a bad cookie.
About 3 out of every 4 pints i buy come like this and its grown to be a bugger. I know it may have alot to do with the shipment process, but this was not a problem before and i cant imagine the amount of first time tryers they are shooing away due to this error. This is my favorite ice cream and i hope this issue gets resolved."

Half way through and still.... nothing.. just vanilla and chocolate .. oh wait... 1 piece of brownie.. :((
The vanilla and chocolate was as good as ever! But misssing the gobs of goodness !! I am thinking... maybe I got the special pint??? :))
I am a regular..sometimes daily! Pint eater.. so it won't slow me down.. I am guessing, better luck next time!? Hope so!
Here is the upc # 76840 10132 just in case inquiring minds would like to know!?
Bottom of container # is 84141103 maybe that will help get to the bottom of

Before they were distinct cubes of chewy, rich goodness! What happened? Is it a specific distribution center or something or did they change the formula somehow? This is my favorite flavor of Ben n Jerry’s, and honestly my favorite flavor of ice cream in general. But not the last month... Consistently disappointing is how I would sum up my experience."

I normally go for that one because of the bigger chunks of brownie but this is a go to favorite, Best of Both Worlds. You get brownie and chocolate chip cookie dough and they're not small pieces so when you actually get to a piece you are in for a real treat. the brownies remind me of the corner pieces of the brownie Pan and the chocolate chip cookie dough is sweet but has that little bit of salt that you get from eating an actual cookie but then the ice cream is vanilla and chocolate. Please try to tell me I'm wrong and try it out for yourselves you will love it!"

The remains of the pint are deep in my freezer now but I feel the urge to set it free. Great balance of vanilla and a superb chocolate ice cream and generous bites of brownie. The perfect way to eat brownie, too - saturated with creamy rich ice cream. And THEN there is cookie dough, too! It ALL tastes good, together and individually."

I threw away the first one like this, wasting 8e, when the second one was the same I ate it anyway thinking it must just be a recipe change and observed that the brownie is also compromised, like hard and stale. Now a third one is like this and I see similar comments. Something wrong here. Please fix it. How could this happen to such a flagship product without you noticing?"

I would eat the entire pint and go to the store the next day to buy another one. This went on for MONTHS! Now, I definitely had to slow down because eating that much sugar on a regular basis was making my thighs a little thicker than I would've like but, hey, I still curl up on the couch every now and then, turn on a good movie or tv series on Netflix, and eat my go to comfort snack, Ben & Jerry's Half Baked Ice Cream.

The brownie and cookie dough chunks almost feel like some sort of low-cal, diet substitutes of their former selves. They are chalky, dry, and difficult to eat. The ice cream is still good, but overall the experience is pretty terrible. I have to give up on this flavor. It's not worth the calories anymore!"

A lot of people have complained about the change from Chocolate covered peanutbutter FILLED pretzels to chocolate covered peanutbutter pretzels (it is my understanding that this was due to the original pretzels no longer being available to B&J's). While I do thing that the original was better in principal, I found that I frequently got pints where the pretzels were soggy and disappointing. I have never had that happen with the new recipe. The new pretzels are always crunch and a little bit saltier, which I actually prefer; I need the salt to balance the fudge and vanilla malt. Still the best!"

In the past year, I have noticed that the cookie dough has been very chalky and not at all chewy like it once was. Additionally, the brownie bites are no longer chewy and distinguishable, instead they just disappear with the chocolate ice cream. I attributed this to the fact that I stocked up on this particular ice cream however even with more recent purchases I have noticed that cookie dough and brownie bites are no longer the same texture and quantity as they used to be. This is my favorite ice cream so I hope they are able to pinpoint what exactly is going on with the recipe since they have said they have not changed it."

There was also a severe lack of cookie dough and the brownie was stale. Very unfortunate and now I am scared to buy any more pints.
28_bj,,2018-11-04,5,,0,0,This is my favorite ice cream brand. The chunks of all of the cookie dough are really big so you get the brownie or cookie dough in every bite. The ice cream itself is super creamy and delicious. I love the pint size because it can usually give you 3-4 servings depending on how much you eat at a time. I highly recommend everyone try and flavor of Ben and Jerry’s! The names of the ice cream are also very clever.

The cookie dough and brownie chunks were super good and the ice cream was nice and creamy. The only downside was that it was hard to scoop the ice cream because the brownie chunks were really hardened. Overall, it was amazing, but I'll have to stop myself from eating the whole pint!"
28_bj,hillaryr2,2018-11-11,5,,0,0,"Half Baked by Ben & Jerry's is my ULTIMATE favourite! It's one of those flavours flavours that if you haven't tried it yet, you simply havent lived. Once you do try it, it will be your go-to choice of Ben & Jerry's too! A delicious blend of creamy vanilla ice cream, with fudge brownies (my favourite part) and gobs of chocolate chip cookie dough. Would highly recommend!"
28_bj,KayforIceCream,2017-12-06,4,Half baked addict!,0,0,"This is one of my all-time favorite flavors. There's something about the combination of cookie dough and brownie bites that's just delish! My only worry? I have noticed that the ice cream to brownie/cookie dough has changed. I know find fewer dough/brownie bites in each pint. Hoping that they'll readjust that soon, or even better yet come out with a ""packed"" version."
28_bj,richardsara,2020-07-25,5,,0,0,"This is my go to flavor whenever I have extra money to splurge on ice cream for myself. I love the bites of cookie dough and then you have the bites of fudge brownie. Oh my gosh, it is just so good!!!!! If you like cookie dough and brownies YOU HAVE TO TRY this out NOW!!!!! Mmmmmmm.....no review will be enough to make you understand how good this one is."

28_bj,,2020-07-30,5,,0,0,"Oh my my my!! I LOVEEEE Ben & Jerrys Half Baked ice cream. I have on occasion ate a whole pint of this by myself. When Im craving something more than a simple flavored ice cream this is my first choice hands down. After a long day at work, nothing is better than a pint of good old Ben and Jerrys Half Baked, eating it with a spoon out of the carton in bed."
28_bj,dhara9435,2020-07-26,5,,0,0,This is definitely one of my ALL TIME fav ice creams. I literally always have atleast a pint of it in my freezer for bad days and my bf knows when it finishes to replace it because it's just what gets me through bad days. It's all things delicious in 1 ice icream. It's got fudge Brownie and it's got cookie dough... I mean really what more do you need?
28_bj,beautyinbeer,2018-10-23,5,,0,0,"I love this ice cream. I just wish I could eat more of it for less calories, but who doesn't wish that about ice cream? I've used it to make my own popsicles by slicing it horizontally with a good knife, popping off the carton, putting a popsicle stick in it then dipping it in melted chocolate and refreezing. Helps me control how much I eat."
28_bj,alsull1s,2020-07-25,5,,0,0,My love for ice cream is deep and this flavor is seriously perfection. It has everything you want in an ice cream. I think I buy this every week its so good. It has the perfect amount of vanilla to chocolate ice cream with GOBS of cookie dough and brownie bites. The brownie is the most amazing part. I love you #ben&jerrys for making this!!!
28_bj,kendalina,2020-07-06,5,,0,0,"This is one of my all time favorite ice creams. It was a staple in my freezer in college. I love the creamy texture, delicious ingredients, and reasonable cost. I also LOVE that Ben and Jerrys pay all of their employees a liveable wage, are politically active, and donate to charities. It is definitely worth the slightly higher price point."
28_bj,zurrealcurls,2020-07-30,5,,0,0,"Munchies anyone? I mean, come on, its Ben & Jerrys! Some of the best ice cream combos ever. You really cant go wrong with any of their treats.

If they ever came out with larger sizes at a similar price, that would be the best day of my life lol, its SO worth it."
28_bj,lexilovesmakeup,2020-06-03,5,,0,0,"This is my drunk ice cream. The brownie batter, the cookie dough, ugh. Such a perfect combination and I could kiss whoever invented this. I will share this one because its a great pick me up and it doesn't make me feel the need to hoard it to myself. I want others to experience the same euphoria I feel when I get a nice glob of dough."
28_bj,jovieb2006,2020-07-26,5,,0,0,I absolutely love this ice cream!! My all time favorite Ben and Jerrys ice cream! One of my favorite parts about this ice cream is it has chocolate and vanilla combined in it! The fudge brownie bits are so amazing as well as the chocolate chip cookie dough. 10/10 recommend getting this! [product:ben-&-jerrys-ice-cream-half-baked-16oz]
28_bj,lbs1217,2020-07-21,3,,0,0,"Reading the description of this describes my perfect ice cream flavor. But, for some reason, Ben and Jerrys doesnt do it for me. I am not the biggest fan of supermarket ice cream, I would much rather get it from a parlor. Something about it tastes artificial and I cant get past it. However, its the best flavor out of all of theirs."
28_bj,britta5,2020-06-05,5,,0,0,This is hands down my favorite ice cream! A creamy ice cream base with delicious cookie dough and brownie bites mixed in. They are generous with the cookie dough and brownie bites too! My favorite way to eat this is to try to eat around all the added bits and save the bits (best part) for last and just eat spoonfuls of the bits.
28_bj,brandyh20,2020-07-27,4,,0,0,"This is my absolute favorite ice cream. I love Ben and Jerry's. I love everything about them. The company itself is awesome. It's so sweet and delicious, they are all good but this is by far my favorite. You can find it anywhere. It's got chunks of cookie and they have a half baked core that has more cookie dough in it's so good"
28_bj,,2018-08-02,5,,0,0,"Half baked is so yummy because it has all of my favorite things in it. It has chocolate and vanilla ice cream with cookie dough and brownie. It’s so yummy especially when it is at the perfect temperature, to me that’s slightly melted to make it soft and smooth. This is definitely one of my favorite flavors from Ben and Jerry’s."
28_bj,Amelia2902,2020-09-03,5,Incredible!!!!,0,0,"When I buy ice cream with chunks, I'm always disappointed with how few and little the pieces are. However, this ice cream is by far the most satisfying chunk-containing ice cream I've had so far! The chunks of fudge brownie and cookie dough are the size of my spoon AND are evenly throughout the pint. So ADDICTING!!!!!"
28_bj,elyseh2,2020-07-25,5,,0,0,"I love this ice cream. A perfect blend of chocolate and vanilla, brownie and cookie dough. The brownie and cookie dough are large and delicious in the ice cream. A classic Ben and Jerrys flavor that will never disappoint. And they make it in a frozen yogurt option too which is equally as delicious but fewer calories."
28_bj,kirstenb,2020-07-19,5,,0,0,One of my all time favorite ice creams. I especially love that I can pick up a pint of Ben and Jerrys and have my own little personal ice cream potion to attack through out the week when I want a taste.

Half baked Ben and Jerry's is a million times better than their basic ice creams, and the different chunks and flavors are an absolute delight. Give it a go!"
28_bj,biancal05e3,2020-05-29,5,,0,0,Ben and Jerrys is my all time favourite ice cream because first of all it has so many flavours and this one is my fave. This one mixes cookie dough with brownies and chocolate and vanilla and I think maybe a hint of peanut butter inside and it is just so delicious I can literally eat one pot just to myself hahah.
28_bj,jessica_ulrich,2019-01-03,5,,0,0,"This is my go to treat of choice. Is is SUPER expensive though. $5 for a pint. However, it does have brownie and cookie dough pieces in it, so I get it. When I do treat myself to it, I almost always eat the whole pint in one sitting. It’s delicious, chocolatey, and the brownie pieces are so so soft. I love this."
28_bj,Joe34,2017-07-22,4,Good but also disappointing,0,0,"I bought a pint of Half Baked (my favorite flavor) and even though it said it was Half Baked, it was actually just a chocolate and vanilla mix with no cookie or brownie pieces. This is the second time this has happened to me in the past few months. Hopefully its just a production issue and not a new standard."
28_bj,kylen19c7,2020-07-05,5,,0,0,"Ben and Jerrys ice cream is known everywhere for their amazing flavor and quality. The half baked is my favorite, Im a huge fan of cookie dough and when you combine that with brownies it just does something for me.

28_bj,,2020-07-24,5,,0,0,I love Ben & Jerrys not just for the ice cream they have a really good quality ice cream but because the mission behind their brand did you know they hire recently released criminals and they pay the $16 an hour 75% of their income goes to paying back incarcerated youth I love them for that #PrisonReform

The ice cream is it's usual creamy and rich quality but adding in the extra flavours gives it more of a boost and more texture. This is my new favourite."
28_bj,valerieh23,2020-07-27,5,,0,0,"Cookie dough & ice cream together is a happy blend for me. This is a combination I haven't seen anywhere else. It's good as is, but adding a chocolate ribbon through it couldn't hurt. (Just sayin') If you like chocolate & are a cookie dough fan, this is worth trying."
28_bj,SAPHORA86,2020-05-19,5,The best of 2 fav ice creams in one,0,0,This is my favorite ice cream in the world i buy one pint a month and its ingredients are high quality I love the plastic seal so I know it's not been pre licked lol.

28_bj,gretchens,2020-07-26,3,,0,0,Wasn't my favorite flavor of ben & jerry's not going to lie. I would like it better with more peanut butter flavor in the ice cream. I think if they added a little more flavor to it it would honestly be a favorite of mine. I'd give it a 3/5! Honestly could be better.
28_bj,katemariebeauty18,2020-07-02,5,,0,0,Best flavor of ben and jerrys hands down. You get both their iconic cookie doimugh and fudge brownie bits in one pint. This ice cream is def nore expensive than others but worth every penny. Try and find on sale bogo. Ben and Jerry is also socially conscious company

28_bj,jaywallk,2020-07-14,5,,0,0,This is by far the best Ben and Jerrys ice cream Ive ever had. And I especially love the fact that the owners support the same causes that I do like BLM and the LGBTQ+ community. Thats hey Ill continue to buy their overpriced ice cream and live every bite of it.
28_bj,brendabccc1,2020-07-24,5,,0,0,Best of both worlds! Ben & Jerry's combines chocolate chip cookie dough and brownies in a delicious ice cream. This is one of my favorites. Only thing I would add to this is chopped walnuts. A little pricier than other ice cream at this size but still worth it.

28_bj,ecapelorac,2020-06-19,5,,0,0,"Ben and Jerrys get 10/10.
They hire felons, pay living wage, donate, have been arrested when protesting for the greater good. They may be on the expensive side but when you find out all the good they do it is absolutely worth it.

28_bj,brieoc,2020-07-28,3,,0,0,Tried this ice cream because of all the great reviews but it was just too sweet for me. If you have a high tolerance for sugar like my boyfriend (who likes this brand) then you may enjoy this but to me it just tasted overly sugary.
28_bj,cellissalovesyou,2019-12-05,5,,0,0,The best mixture of cookie dough and brownie. Its not the most expensive but it also isnt the cheapest but for the quality I would say its worth it! This is my go to ice cream I have it atleast once a week as a little weekend treat

I love the vanilla ice cream with the brownies and the cookie dough, that's the really good portion. The chocolate ice cream is very strong, and too overwhelming to combine nicely with this."
28_bj,tiffanyscents17,2020-07-29,5,,0,0,Can you say delicious??? Growing up in Maine I was able to enjoy fresh Ben & Jerry's ice cream at out local beaches. The way they make their pints is so amazing and just like the fresh ice cream you get. This flavor is so so yummy.

29_bj,Impressed28,2019-08-17,5,Throw out your other cookies n cream,7,0,"And don't buy them ever again. It's a waste of your money. Because Ben and Jerry have finally made the best cookies n cream and brought it too the masses. Instead of vanilla icecream with a cookie crumb every now and then, it's jam packed with cookies. It's everything cookies n cream fans have always wanted.
I bought this at my local Walmart last week and was blown away. Finished the pint in 2 days. I went back to the store multiple times, couldn't find it. I've called many other Walmarts. They were all out too. Grab this one while you can! Get two or three even!"
29_bj,CameronT,2019-08-06,5,Cookies and Cream 2.0,20,0,"Ben & Jerry's has reinvented my favorite basic ice cream flavor, Cookies and Cream. This should just replace all Cookies and Cream flavors everywhere and be the new standard for what is Cookies and Cream. Finally, someone actually put enough cookies in the ice cream. Usually, Cookies and Cream tastes like vanilla ice cream with the ocasional taste of cookie. This seems to be the other way around and I love it. Big cookie pieces! I hope this flavor never goes away."
29_bj,SnackinMom87,2019-07-06,5,Omgggg,11,2,"Attn:: So my 6 year old saw this flavor and asked me to buy it, i did. He eats the carton within 2 days saying it was the best he ever tasted, super rare for him to devour ice cream that fast.. Beggs for another carton, I carry on and I go buy another carton for him. Later on my hubby is making a cup for my son and he randomly tasted it. Came to me like babe thats the best cookie and cream ice cream i ever had, ranting and raving... So me going to being nosey in the middle of the night i secures a cup. WHOOOOAAAAA! Blown away with its deliciousness. Needless to say i have to go to the store tomorrow to replace my sons carton LOL. We are all addicted. BNJ PUHHHHLEEEEASEEEE DO NOT GET RID OF THIS FLAVOR! I see those limited edition wrappings! Please don't do it. LOL. Sincerely The Late Night Snackin Mom"
29_bj,Icecreamfan4life,2019-05-09,5,YAY for B&J making a cookies and cream flavor!!!,3,0,"I picked this up with the Red, White and blueberry shortbread and the The Sweet like sugar new flavor as well a few days ago. And have to say that I was not disappointed at all. I know this is more of a tamer flavor for the company. But I can't help but feel that is what makes this flavor the best. Because there are so many cookies and cream variations out there, that don't always taste the best. And this one definitely does not disappoint with this shopper. Keep it up."
29_bj,Demi252,2019-07-05,5,OMG OMG OMG,3,0,"So another brand use to have Ice Cream Sandwich ice cream but they stopped selling it and all this year I have been searching. Alas, here comes B&J to save the day. I absolutely love and have bought like 3 -4 cartons of it since it's come out. Cookies and Cream but amplified!! If you guys bring out Superman ice cream I know that B&J pays attention to their customer base!!"

The right amount of cookies and vanilla and goodness wrapped into one beautiful pint! Please please please do not stop making this and please have it at more stores because I can only get it at one.

29_bj,Chicksluvrock,2019-08-05,5,Whooooa boy,1,0,I can’t even begin to describe to you how good this is. Forget about all other cookies and cream ice creams. You don’t need other ones anymore. THIS is everything cookies and cream should be. It’s so riddled with cookie crumbs and big cookie chunks it’s a cookie dream come true. You won’t be disappointed with this one! Excellent job Ben & Jerry’s! Never stop making this!
29_bj,Vivicart,2019-06-24,5,Best cookies and cream icecream ever!,1,1,I have been looking for this flavor ever since I heard of its release. I’m a lover of all things cookies and cream and this icecream didn’t disappoint. I hope that this becomes a permanent flavor because it is now my favorite flavor. The flavors are intense and the cookie flavor is so yummy. Please please don’t take this flavor away. The is only one store in my area that carries it so I buy it in threes with no shame. Sooooo freaking good!
29_bj,Tb1214,2019-06-04,5,Way better than expected!,1,0,I picked this up last week at Walmart and I’m glad I did. The best cookies and cream ice cream I’ve ever had. For some reason I wasn’t expecting as good as it was and it blew me away. Hopefully this one never goes away! Definitely pick it up if you’re at a Wal-Mart
29_bj,Bsaucier,2019-09-04,5,Simply amazing!!,1,0,My husband and I could eat this by the gallon if it were available. We can’t even share a pint and always have to buy one each. I can only hope that this flavor becomes widespread and never leaves the line up! We are addicted! :)
29_bj,jasssgee,2019-08-27,5,LITERALLY THE BEST B&J EVER,1,0,"Bought this yesterday and I was not disappointed. As an avid Cookies & Cream eater, this looked enticing, but it was SOOO much better than expected. PLEASE do not get rid of this one ever!!!"

29_bj,CookieswirlFORLIFE,2019-11-11,5,OMG. YES.,0,0,"I loved the old Vermonty Python ice cream by Ben + Jerry because of the delicious cookie swirl but then they discontinued it. THEN, I liked milk and cookies only for the cookie swirl and would eat around the ice cream just looking for the swirls as the rest was too sweet. NOW this has CHANGED MY ICE CREAM LIFE! Cookie ice cream with cookie swirls, holy moly I am so excited about this. Best B+J ice cream YET. Please keep this one forever!"
29_bj,Mrbeast6000,2019-04-29,4,Pretty good,4,6,"This ice cream was pretty good, had a nice combo of flavor and a good balance of chocolate."

The Tonight Dough, Americone Dream, and Half Baked used to be in a tie for my favorite until I had this. It’s like your classic cookies and cream but BETTER. And I love ice cream sandwiches so that, to me, is the best part. It’s so delicious!"
29_bj,Savanna,2019-05-29,5,Best cookies and cream!!!,1,1,This is legit the best cookies and cream ice cream. Probably one of the best pints of ice cream out there.
29_bj,SOT24,2019-10-02,5,Best ice cream I’ve ever had,0,0,"I’ve never written a review before, but I had to after eating this. It combines my two favorite things in the world (ice cream sandwiches and sandwich cookies) and jam packs them into a perfect pint. Every spoon has so much of both so you’re never left digging around to get more cookie. PLEASE never stop making this flavor!!"
29_bj,Raebirds,2020-07-06,5,New Fav...,0,0,"Ben & Jerry’s continues to be my emotional support during this crazy pandemic. This flavor is 1 of 7 pints purchased. I can’t wait to try the other 3 new flavors. Thanks B&J! Also, love this companies stance fondness for equality and justice for all."

30_bj,clouds513,2019-07-31,5,"The best flavor, anyone can fight me on this.",105,0,"I've been buying Milk & Cookies for i don't even know how long. I have to drive 30 minutes total just to go get it because none of my local stores have it. It's officially ruined all other cookies & cream flavored ice creams for me, nothing can top it. I mean, it't got TWO kinds of cookies in it. What??? Man that's a lot of cookie. And you know, every time I buy a pint, I always think ""man, is this $4-something-or-other worth it for just one pint?"" and every time I get a different brand's cookies and cream flavor I always get my answer. It's absolutely worth it. This will be served at my wedding, and most certainly at my funeral. If anyone comes up to me and tries to convince me there's a better flavor out there, they can expect nothing less than a full on war."
30_bj,Squilly,2020-01-23,5,The G.O.A.T,10,1,"I recently came across the Milk&Cookies flavor at my local convenient store and...WOW! If Oreo, Chips Ahoy, Tate's, Milano, and Nutella came together to make the best flavor of ice cream ever, it would not even come close to Milk&Cookies. The only problem is that I am becoming addicted and it is starting to affect my social life. Although my girlfriend dumped me and my friends no longer want to spend time with me, I will never stop eating Milk&Cookies Ice Cream. I am willing to take out a mortgage in order to purchase Milk&Cookie Ice Cream in larger quantities. Thank you Ben. Thank you Jerry."
30_bj,Phish Food Fan,2019-02-26,5,One yummy flavor,6,0,"This is just what I was hoping for tonight. I love Ben and Jerry’s chocolatey, caramely, marshmallowy gooie flavors the most but tonight I wanted something different. I wanted exactly what Milk and Cookies delivered; a delicious vanilla ice cream with cookie swirls. No fudge chunks or nuts or oozey mix ins this time (even though that’s my favorite). Just a perfect ‘dry’ blend of cookie swirls and excellent vanilla ice cream. I will get this one every time I need a break from the Phish Food, Karamel Sutra and peanut butter fudge cores of the world. Awesome flavor!"
30_bj,Rocko13,2017-05-08,4,THE BEST - Just needs to be in more stores,9,0,"I was going to give it 5-stars, because it's BY FAR the best ice cream flavor that I've ever tasted! However, Milk & Cookies isn't available in a lot of stores, so it's definitely a challenge to find sometimes. Our local Whole Foods is really the only place that carries it. But, if you can find it, TRY IT! You won't be disappointed!"
30_bj,layla,2017-06-19,5,LOVE!,12,1,"I've been buying Ben & Jerry's for ages now, but I've never really been consistent with a certain flavor. I've always kept buying new ones to try. I'm on vacation in Florida, and found the Milk & Cookies one in the local grocery store and HAD to try it. Needless to say, we went back and grabbed 3 more the next day!"
30_bj,Brighton,2017-05-15,5,The best flavor!,8,0,I tried this flavor once because they were out of my past fav- Cookie Dough. This one is a million times better! The cookies are amazing. The ice cream is amazing. Everything together is awesome. Thank you Ben and Jerry's for an awesome flavor. I could eat 20 pints of this.
30_bj,Chelle8,2020-06-01,5,THE BEST. EVERRR.,2,1,"I am the lady who will buy up the whole store if I see cookies & milk B&J ice cream on the shelf. I ate 2 pints in one day once! It all started, they were out of cookie dough (my old favorite) so decided to try the next best cookie thing on the shelf. Boy was I GLAD I did. It became my new favorite INSTANTLY. It’s so good though I have to really warm folks that you may NEVER want another flavor again. That’s what’s happened to me going on 3 years now since discovering it. My only problem with it is I’m mad I didn’t find out about it sooner!! I LOVE EVERY BUT ABOUT! 100 thumbs up!!! MMMMMM"
30_bj,Sfnelly420,2017-10-30,5,Great combination!,1,0,LOVE THIS ICE CREAM! Its the perfect combination.!! Thank you Ben & Jerrys
30_bj,liv1,2020-02-28,5,The absolute best Ben & Jerry's flavor,2,0,"Every time I get ice cream this is the flavor I reach for, some people think it's a boring flavor but that is in no way accurate. It combines my favorite flavors, cookie dough and cookie's & cream creating the ultimate ice cream. With no overpowering crazy flavors, it took classic flavors and made them better. Ice cream will truly never taste the same - big shoutout to both Ben and Jerry for this one. (also it's a great post-run dessert)"
30_bj,juliew99,2018-02-18,5,New Favorite,2,0,"I had always been strictly Half Baked or Americone Dream, until I tried Milk & Cookies when all others were sold out. Needless to say I found a new reigning favorite. Nothing can compare to the gooey-ness of the cookie swirls - NOTHING. I fell very strongly about this ice cream flavor and I will defend its title as the best Ben & Jerry’s flavor."
30_bj,,2018-02-21,5,My favorite,2,0,"I’m not the type of person to sit and eat a bowl of ice cream but with this flavor I can eat a whole pint, it the best ice cream flavor I have ever had, my boyfriend and I have to drive 30 min away just to buy it because no local stores carry it.. My boyfriend is an ice cream lover and he even says this is the best ice cream ever."
30_bj,klok,2020-04-20,5,#1 best flavor,2,0,I ordered an unspecified pint of Ben & Jerry's from the deli and my delivery guy gave me this gem. I fell in love. It was fate <3
30_bj,FuzzyGut,2018-09-23,3,Pretty good pint,3,8,"I love Ben and Jerry’s and I have for a LONG time. Over the last several months, I’ve decided to spoon my way through every flavor I can get in my area or online and last night was Milk and Cookies. It was definitely yummy but not my favorite. The cookie swirls were GREAT! The vanilla ice cream was for some reason not my favorite. I think a chocolate milk and cookies would be better. And I love Ben and Jerry’s vanilla a lot. All in all, this was a good pint but I like a lot of other flavors more."
30_bj,jasmineg853,2019-06-20,5,"If you love cookies, you'll LOVE THIS!",1,0,"My husband and I have a pint B&Js probably every 3 days. This one is such a hit! We love Half Baked but this one is like a soft cookie sundae. My favorite is getting those little chocolate chips in the mix, it just adds another layer of something already fantastic. It would be dope if there were full sized mini chocolate chips instead of the micro ones. Either way, great flippin' ice cream!"
30_bj,Haley g,2019-11-06,5,My one true love,1,0,"I have a deep and intense love for this ice cream. If I could marry it, I would. B&Js best ice cream flavor by a long shot, and they never skimp on the fix ins. All my friends write it off as just a regular cookies and cream ice cream but NO! This is so much more than that. I would like to be buried in a coffin shaped like a B&Js pint of Milk & Cookies ice cream. That is all."
30_bj,Icrissyc,2018-04-27,5,Give it a try !,1,0,"I found myself wanting ice cream one day and I found this flavor in one of my local stores. I thought it would be strange with 2 different cookies , boy was I wrong ! Definetly one of my favorites of not my top favorite. Besides who's not in the mood for milk and cookies !?! You'd just be crazy if you said you weren't. HIGHLY suggest this flavor you will not regret it !"
30_bj,groovy,2018-09-29,5,CREAM de la creme!,1,0,"I have been getting milk & cookies for years now and when I run out, I HAVE to restock. I don’t normally even have a sweet tooth, but there’s just something about the texture and taste of the cookies mixed with this ice cream! Milk & Cookies is my all time favorite ice cream and I always make my friends try it. You should too!"
30_bj,Stephanie A,2017-05-14,5,Recipe Suggestion,2,1,"This is literally the best ice cream flavor I have ever had! I'm actually eating it as I write this review. I just have one suggestion for the recipe...ADD MORE CHOCOLATE CHIP COOKIES!!!! This is a 10/10 ice cream flavor, but it would be a 20/10 if there were more chocolate chip cookie chunks in it!"
30_bj,ChrisColby,2018-07-25,4,Cookies. Cookies everywhere.,2,2,"Quite possibly the most accurate name for an ice cream flavor. Tastes exactly like cookies dipped in milk. The vanilla base is appropriately subtle enough to let the cookies shine, while adding the creaminess when melting. If there is one flaw, it's in the chocolate chocolate chip cookies which strangely taste a bit fruity. But that might just be me. Great flavor regardless."
30_bj,Tanabear,2019-03-24,5,Cookie chunks!,1,0,"This is my favorite flavor. I get it anytime I am able! I love the swirls of cookie and the huge chunks of cookie that you get mixed in. I don't like cookie dough in ice-cream, so this works superbly. I love that it includes both chocolate cookies and chocolate chip cookies."
30_bj,shanelee266,2018-08-23,5,This cookie swirl is a game changer,1,0,My favorite flavor changes every year or so. Milk & Cookies is this years. What's the point of buying boring cookie dough flavor when this is available? The cookie swirl works so well and is such a great addition to the TWO kinds of cookie dough in this delicious blend.
30_bj,iamironman,2019-08-20,5,Dude. This is the best ice cream ever.,0,0,"This is the best ice cream I have ever had in my life. This ice cream makes me feel like I’m ten again and its the year 2000. The flavor is comparable to:
- Receiving a surprise puppy.
- Playing man-hunt outside with your friends in the middle of the summer.
- The feeling you get when you can finally click “skip ad” on Pandora and YouTube."
30_bj,grinch,2017-08-24,5,Simply the Best,1,0,I have not bought another ice cream in years. This is the best ice cream available in a pint that I have ever had. I have not even gotten sick of this ice cream. The two types of cookies (especially the light one) is absolutely delicious!
30_bj,Andreadiana,2017-12-18,5,A nod to your childhood,0,0,I picked up my first pint of Milk & Cookies a few years ago during a particularly hard time in my life. It was like a soothing balm during my emotional crisis. Could it be because it brings back a sense memory of better childhood times? Possibly. Or could it be because it is so darn tasty. I'm going with the latter. I have to really search my local stores for it and in the rare moments when they do have this flavor I buy multiple pints at once and look like a crazy woman. Thanks B&J. Thank you.
30_bj,PhoenixRises,2019-09-03,5,I just found this gem!,0,0,"Recently I went to a store that didn't have any of my usual favorites, so I grabbed this one just to see what it was like. I know I love cookies, and cookie sundaes so I would probably like it. I'm not a fan of cookie dough ice cream (I like it plain, but not in my ice cream), so I was glad it was regular cookie pieces. It was amazing! I love the chocolate cookie swirls and the chocolate chip cookie pieces. It's only sold at certain stores, so that's the only downside, but it's a new favorite."
30_bj,Freethebrowniebits,2018-05-02,5,"Delicious, so good! Mmm!",2,1,"I bought this for the first time the other day and boy was I in for it. I used to get the fudge brownie but they were always skimpin on the brownie bits. And now here I am, writing a review about ice cream!!!!!"
30_bj,Draper,2019-06-30,5,Five star flavor profile!,1,0,Milk & Cookies is in my top five of favorites from Ben & Jerry’s. The marrying of high quality vanilla ice cream and three types of cookies is a delectable treat sure to satisfy anyone’s sweet tooth.
30_bj,Zach21,2018-03-04,5,Best flavor ever,1,0,Milk & Cookies is the best ice cream flavor you will ever buy. I could eat pints and pints of this. You HAVE to try it! HIGHLY recommend!!!

30_bj,Bellaandjerrys,2018-12-03,5,Classic and delicious,1,0,This ice cream is one of my favorite bnj flavors. I would describe it as a mix of cookie dough and cookies and cream.
30_bj,Shannon H,2018-03-06,5,How do I give this more than 5 stars?,1,0,I once drove almost two hours for a pint of milk and cookies because the grocery store was out of it. Enough said.

I even went to another store, and guess what?? They didn't have it either I went to 3 other stores and nope nope and nope but finally the other day boom they had it ugh I'm enjoying some now as I write ugh I'm in love..... the best"
30_bj,bec99,2019-01-07,5,best combo!!,0,0,Ever since I found this flavor it is the only flavor I will buy. It is the perfect combination of different cookies and only has vanilla ice cream which is different from most flavors and that is a big pro in my eyes. Hands down the best Ben & Jerry’s flavor ever and even though it’s hard for me to find sometimes it is always worth it! Definitely worth straying from your go-to flavor to try this one out!
30_bj,Mymy,2017-06-02,5,Favorite Flavor of all Time,0,0,"This is my absolute favorite flavor of ice cream. Taking the spot from the former champion, green mint chocolate chip, this is the best ice cream I have ever put in my mouth. When I ended a long term relationship and was feeling a bit down, my roommate and her boyfriend went to 6 stores to fine one of these to bring to me. It was the b st cure for a broken heart I ever had."
30_bj,mpg1904,2019-04-17,2,Lacking chocolate cookie swirl,0,3,I’ve had this flavor before and it was delicious but recently I purchased it again and it wasn’t great. My favorite part of this ice cream is the chocolate cookie swirl and unfortunately there was barely any in this pint! The cookie swirl was only in about a quarter of the pint and the rest was the vanilla ice cream with barely any cookie pieces! Very disappointing
30_bj,Lboogie,2019-07-15,2,Usually the best Ben & Jerry’s getting cheap!,1,3,"I have always loved milk and cookies and buy it ALL the time. Recently I have noticed a dramatic decrease in the amount of cookie in the container, it’s mostly just plain vanilla icecream. Very disappointed.. for the top of the line ice cream at almost $6 a pint this is unacceptable."
30_bj,icecreamfan10,2020-09-05,5,Best Flavor!,0,0,"Eating a pint of this ice cream is more satisfying than having actual milk and cookies. This is the best flavor, and yes this is the hill I've chosen to die on. The ice cream is loaded with delicious cookies and chocolate swirls. The milky flavor penetrates the cookies themselves. I hope this flavor is never discontinued because I'd be beyond upset."

They don't skimp on the cookie mix ins, and I haven't seen any other cookies n cream ice cream like this one. This is one of my top three flavors."
30_bj,DC24,2018-09-04,5,What Cookies and Cream Should Be.,0,0,"I love this flavor! It is what cookies and cream should taste like, but seldom does. It is grounded in Ben & Jerry's awesome vanilla with just the right amount of intense chocolate cookie flavor. Honestly, it is hard to describe why this ice cream is so delicious. It just Is! This flavor surpassed my expectations."
30_bj,SamIAm,2018-07-11,5,The best ice cream you will ever eat,0,0,When I tried this ice cream fro the first time my life changed. No flavor can ever live up to it. I feel like a kid again when I eat this ice cream. It seems to not be stocked at most places which is so frustrating and the only downside to this flavor. Try this asap and you'llnever go back to any other flavor.

I est cookies and ice cream often because it is my favorite dessert but this is just amazing!!! Now my dad loves it. Too bad they dont sell it at any of the walmarts near me."
30_bj,,2017-12-02,5,Holy deliciousness!!,0,0,"The only reasoning I have to be disappointed is the fact that I didn't try this flavor sooner!! It is chocked full of cookie bits and has become my new favorite. I can only hope they make this vegan by the time I transition back or I'll be pining for it. For now, I'll be enjoying whenever possible."

CANOLA OIL, SOYBEAN OIL, BUTTEROIL, TAPIOCA STARCH, GUAR GUM & CARRAGEENAN.
i am not sure if i will buy again."

The flavor was too bland for my taste. I don't think I will be buying this again in the near future.
30_bj,Mclopez,2018-05-31,5,Never eating another flavor again!!,0,0,I usually do half baked but decided to try Milk & Cookies a try. It is DEFINITELY a game changer - I'm never buying anything else. I've been talking about it nonstop at work and to my friends. I gave one of my friends some to try and they were obsessed too!
30_bj,Josh from VT,2017-07-26,4,"Good ice cream, but big hole",0,1,"The ice cream and cookie chunks were fantastic, but there was a big air socket in the bottom of my pint which resulted in ~30% of the ice cream being left missing.

I ate two pints in one sitting! My doctor says I need to stop buying Ben and Jerrys because of my diabetes but I can't stop! Aaahhh! I love this ice cream so much that I have to sneak it in the house because my family tries to hide it from me. I've stopped eating regular food and I basically just eat ice cream every meal. This has to be one of my favorite flavors after half baked! Thank you for your service, Ben and Jerry!"
31_bj,Mint4Lyfe,2017-05-06,5,My favorite!,9,0,"Literally my favorite ice cream out of all of the ice cream I've eaten in the world. Sometimes it's hard to find at certain stores, but I'll climb through a freezer door to search for it. #NoShame"

31_bj,James256,2018-01-29,1,Used to be my favorite,8,2,This has always been my favorite but the last 3 pints I have bought have had almost no chocolate cookie chunks! This is very upsetting as this is my favorite ice cream and my favorite park is the cookie chunks. I instead have been left with mint ice cream with a few spattering of what looks like cookie crumbs. For the high price of B&Js I expected more.

31_bj,Chunk Lover,2017-05-02,1,Chocolate cookies where?,6,5,"As a chunk fan who loves half baked, I recently decided to stop loyally buying my pints of Half Baked and gave this flavor a try. I read it was supposed to have big, generous sized cookie pieces all throughout the pint. Well, my pint didn't have a single big cookie chunk! It was just very small crumbles and mainly mint ice cream. I'm so disappointed! I was expecting this to be the ultimate ice cream for chunk lovers based on what I heard. :("
31_bj,BJfan4life,2020-07-30,3,Yummy but disappointing,0,1,"I was so excited to finally try the Mint Chocolate Cookie ice cream. I'm a huge mint chocolate chip fan, mint ice cream fan in general. But with the concoctions that B&J puts together to make some of the best ice cream flavors around, this flavor is disappointing. I would have expected chocolate chunks, swirls of chocolate, or even the Andes mint chocolates that are sold in stores. But this is basically cookies n cream ice cream with mint flavor. The ice cream isn't even green. Yes it's still yummy, but doesn't live up to what Ben & Jerry's is capable of throwing together."
31_bj,Nicki237,2019-07-12,5,Amazing!!!,0,0,"I bought this flavor yesterday at Walgreens for $6.94 and I must say this flavor is ADDICTING! It’s so good. Ben & Jerry’s knows the perfect balance. The mint flavor is clean and authentic and not sickeningly sweet and artificial and it’s not green like most mint ice creams. Plus, the cookies in here are big pieces, the more I ate through the pint, the bigger the cookie pieces got. It’s as if Cookies & Cream Icecream, York Peppermint patty & Oreos had a baby. I just wish it wasn’t so expensive! I need coupons so I can stock up on this flavor! PLEASE Don’t ever get rid of it!"
31_bj,Mquinn,2020-04-24,1,No cookies :(,0,0,First time trying this flavor and it wasn’t good. There were no cookie pieces at all. I kept waiting to get to the bottom and still no cookies. The bottom was even hollow so 1/4 of the container just had nothing but air.
31_bj,Maybeillhaveonemorebite,2017-08-05,5,So so so good,2,0,"I don't write reviews, or didn't prior to today...I love this ice cream so much, it encompasses everything about a mint and chocolate cookie combination that makes me dream about eating more and more and more. I would live inside my pint if I could, build a little mint ice cream igloo with a cookie door, eat my way out and rebuild"
31_bj,MintBinch,2019-02-05,5,Holy Grail of Pints,2,0,"I check for this flavor every single time I'm in an ice cream isle, even if I'm not buying ice cream that day. I *scout* for it, all over the US. And I almost NEVER find it. I found the first pint in the last five years and it's still the best ice cream pint there is. Fresh but decadent but light but chomky. The fricken best."

But, unfortunately now, its made with coconut oil and I'm allergic to coconut. I wish I would've looked at the container before purchasing it. I did look at the website before going to the store, and didn't see coconut oil in the ingredients. Maybe the website needs to be updated?? Would be more vigilant next time at the store and read all products. Ben & Jerry's does make great ice cream, I just got to be more proactive and always double check."
31_bj,Nate,2019-12-06,1,The mint flavor that is forever leading you on.,0,1,"At first bite I could taste a mellow mint flavor over what is otherwise Chocolate Cookie Vanilla Ice Cream; sadly I sat there eating the rest of the pint not out of enjoyment but out of a desperate attempt to acquire the elusive mint flavor that was lacking. Long story short, I ate the entire pint and was disappointed not only in this flavor but myself. Also the texture was missing that of a chewy/crunch found only in a chocolate chip; if you are looking for that added chocolaty textured greatness the cookie alone will not bring you any solace."
31_bj,Evelyn,2019-03-19,5,Taste Bud Satisfactory!,1,0,"I like big chunks and I cannot lie! You other B&J fans can't deny! Well, most of you- my friend prefers sorbet. Anyway, ever since Mint Oreos have been put on the shelves, they've been my favorite flavor! So when I saw this at my grocery store, I did a happy dance in the frozen aisle. The peppermint is to die for, and the chocolate sandwich cookies are like oreos! You did it again, B&J."
31_bj,FuzzyGut,2018-06-07,5,Best mint chocolate ice cream around!,1,0,"My wife and I are both mint chocolate ice cream fans so when we found this one at the store, we had to try it. First off, the mint ice cream: rich, creamy, minty and delicious. And the mint tastes natural. Sometimes other brand’s mint tastes so artificial. Next, not satisfied with chips, this ice cream gives you whole cream-filled cookies! Awesome awesome stuff."
31_bj,mintlover12,2018-11-13,5,a classic!!,1,0,as a mint lover i can truthfully say that this is one of the best! my mom buys this one for me all the time though there are usually very little left in store. i highly recommend this one! much better than minter wonderland which is an abomination to this planet(see my review):) i would add an image of a happy gamer but the stock images are invalid lol
31_bj,Foreversienna,2017-10-12,2,Not enough chunks,2,2,I read several review on the good size of chunks and Great flavors. So when I was at my local supermarket and I saw this flavor I decided to step away from my usual purchase of phish food and half baked. But unfortunately I was very disappointed. There were no large chunks like reviews said. I am hoping thsi was a manufacturing error of some sort but the small pieces I did taste were also odd tasting.
31_bj,Spocksdottir,2018-11-09,5,Excellent,1,0,"I don't enjoy chocolate chunks/chips in cold foods, but I like mint ice cream so much that I have bought mint chocolate chip ice cream, grudgingly eating around cocoa clusters. Thanks to Ben & Jerry's, there are no longer any obstacles to my enjoymint! Cookies are texturally lovely in this minty pint."

31_bj,coclico,2020-09-02,5,Disgustingly good.,0,0,"The mint cookie is truly the most supreme ice cream flavor ever invented: not too minty, not too chocolatey... perfect distribution of ingredients, and don't get me started on the exquisite texture. It's unfortunate that I have to eat the whole pint in one sitting. I recently moved to a city with a store that has this magnificent flavor stocked almost every day. The previous place I lived... there was some sort of shortage. I could only find it in random stores once or twice a year. SO, you'd think this is a GOOD thing: that I now have access to my favorite flavor almost every day. Guys, this is a HORRIBLE thing. The store near me is also open 24 hours... you get the picture. So, I declare to anyone who reads these things: TODAY IS MY LAST DAY TO TASTE AND ENJOY THIS SUPERB AMBROSIA> I'm kicking it... tomorrow. "

This ice cream even takes it a step further by having a cookies and cream twist. i was surprised the first time I had opened it because I thought maybe the label was wrong, but when I dug in, I could not be happier.

31_bj,Anna,2018-01-19,3,Slight tweaks could really improve,0,2,"I love this flavor, I love chocolate cookies in everything. But recently I've noticed the cream filling of the cookies has a really weird, unpleasant texture...kind of hard and crumbly. No one is here for the filling anyway, get rid of that! Also a few pints I've gotten have had almost whole cookies in there. Not easy to eat, break them up more! If you did these two things, this flavor would be A+."
31_bj,Rocko13,2017-05-07,1,No Good - Disappointed - Pass on this Flavor,1,5,"Was excited to try a new flavor of Ben & Jerry's, but I just ended up being super disappointed in Mint Chocolate Chip. It had a very, VERY strong mint flavor and almost no chocolate cookies, it was very strange. Maybe I just got a bad pint, which is very possible, because this was just no good. I wish I would have spent that money on a different flavor."
31_bj,Hat City,2017-07-31,1,Gross!!,1,3,"Since Mint Chip isn't available by the pint, and no scoop shops exist where I live, I tried this flavor and was beyond disappointed. The cookies are disgusting, it tasted like soggy Oreos coated in toothpaste and glue. I will never buy another pint, unless Mint Chip miraculously becomes available."
31_bj,Kiki123456,2018-07-15,1,Really disappointed,0,1,So I just bought this today and from the reviews I was expecting a lot of cookie chunks. I guess I was wrong because after eating half the pint I got ZERO cookie chunks just some very disappointing specks of cookie. The mint taste is also VERY strong to the point where you start feeling sick. I’m really disappointed with this ice cream and I REALLY don’t recommend it.
31_bj,Iheartmint,2018-01-15,1,"No, thank you!",1,1,"I recently bought Ben & Jerry's - Mint Chocolate Cookie ice cream. Unfortunately, this ice cream did not taste like mint."
31_bj,anju8776,2018-10-25,5,,0,0,Ben & Jerry's really nailed it with this ice cream. It is so good! Ben & Jerry's is known for their quality and this is no exception.A excellent mint taste and ice cream treat. I just wish they would include more mint cookie pieces.This has become my new favorite ice cream. The mint and Oreo cookies are a perfect combination.
31_bj,brooke,2019-01-29,1,why tf is it not green ??????,0,7,"Im sorry, maybe i dont know how to read, but im pretty sure this says MINT chocolate chip ice cream?? am i wrong? this simply looks like oreos in vanilla ice cream, which is obviously VERY BORING and no where near exciting as MINT chocolate chip. i dont even want to buy this after seeing these photos. #disappointed."

A delicious treat that is the perfect size for just a coulple of people. The only complain I have would be that it is a little bit pricy for not a lot of ice cream"
31_bj,Jack,2018-03-31,5,DREAM FLAVOR,0,0,"This is by far the best flavor in the world. It has all the right flavors, and textures. By only complaint is that it is not infinite.

31_bj,WillLOVESMintChocCookie,2017-07-14,5,My All-Time Favorite!,0,0,The Mint Chocolate Cookie has become a fun search and devour game for my wife and I. No matter where we are traveling if we go into a store that sells ice cream we look for B&J's MCC. It's getting harder to find. I fear one day you may kill the cookie and send it to your graveyard.
31_bj,,2019-04-01,5,The best mint ever,0,0,I eated last year in my USA trip and loved it!The cookies go way better than just chocolate chips.Its even better because in Brazil they only have one kind of mint ice cream that is no available in the grocery stores any that have giant chunks of chocolate in a enormous quantity.
31_bj,beansky,2018-05-08,5,Best flavor of all time,0,0,"This has been my favorite flavor for YEARS! I love it so much and have driven to the store at night just to buy it.

31_bj,kierstin,2018-11-10,4,,0,0,"I really like this ice cream because it is really good for the cost. The only thing that I wish is that they had a strictly mint chip ice cream instead of the one with cookies. Other than that, I buy it all the time and it is really good!"

31_bj,andreah9,2018-10-12,5,,0,0,This ice cream is fantastic. Flavour is great and truly refreshing. It is probably my favourite brand of ice cream but I barely buy it because the price is ridiculous. The portions are tiny and expensive. Maybe change the packaging?

31_bj,alwest27,2019-01-03,5,,0,0,Ben and Jerry’s are my main men. But seriously they make the best Ice cream and have so many flavors. Every time I’m in the grocery store it is so hard to choose just one flavor to take home with.

It’s not as minty as Mint Chocolate Cookie, which is fine, and the dark chocolate ice cream is so decedent! The marshmallow is a perfect addition and the cookie is great. I’m glad I found this new flavor. Yum yum!"
32_bj,Nik5,2018-11-11,5,Drooling,8,1,"I was so sad when Gimme S'mores season was over but when I saw Minter Wonderland staring at me through the freezer case door, I knew it was meant to be. It's decadantly creamy and perfectly chocolately. Not too rich or bitter like a lot of other dark chocolates; plus the gooeyness of the marshamallows balances with the crunchiness of the cookies. One of my favorite flavors EVER."
32_bj,Jonathan L,2020-02-06,5,Review Time.,7,0,"I have contemplated this review for quite some time. Unfortunately, it is officially time to let you all know about the greatest ice cream EVER MADE! I am flabbergasted that more people have never heard of this ingenious creation. It is by far the most perfected ice cream, which contains the best combination of flavors and ingredients to hit this planet. I am saddened to know that this review will for sure be read by millions and in turn lower my chances of being the only one at my local target eating this ice cream. I have withheld this important message for this long due to my own need to always have a fully stocked freezer of this amazing product. All i ask is that if you are contemplating buying more than 15 of these pints at once, just leave enough for myself to stock my personal Minter Wonderland freezer at home. Now to get to the real reason for this review. I am hoping that one of the millions that read this review may work for Ben and Jerry's or Target and start the long needed process to make this ice cream available ALL year and in ALL locations. Thank you and please do not touch MY Minter Wonderland pint."
32_bj,Stephhy,2020-02-19,1,What mint?,3,15,"Minter Wonderland, leaves you wondering where the mint is. Mint chocolate cookie has more of a mint taste. I was so excited to try, but incredibly disappointed."
32_bj,Kaitlyn,2018-11-11,5,So good I had to write a review,4,1,"I'm only a few bites in but it is so good I couldn't help but write a review. Decadent dark chocolate, mint, and marshmallow- couldn't ask for much more."
32_bj,md1580,2020-02-09,5,Decadent Dark Chocolate,0,0,"While this ice cream wasn't as minty as I was expecting it to be, the dark chocolate flavor was so rich and so spot on. Dark chocolate ice creams and milk shakes are my favorite and surprisingly most difficult flavor to find. I was instantly hooked on the dark chocolate flavor of this ice cream. The minty cookies are refreshing and the marshmallow swirl adds just the perfect sweetness."
32_bj,erin2251,2019-02-09,5,the best,1,0,seriously... this is THE BEST flavor ever.... I wish it wasnt exclusive to Target only (always sold out)
32_bj,leeann337,2020-01-19,5,It was mint to be my fave!,0,0,"O M G I tasted this and dashed to the store to clean out the freezer of this earthly delight! It is hands down THE best dark chocolate I have tasted, and the marshmallow and mint are perfect. I let my daughter taste some (yeah, WHAT was I thinking?) and now I will have to battle her in seeking and buying it all at the local stores. My freezer has 6 pints in it--LOL. would I recommend it?-- My answer says YES, but my heart says NO!-more for me!"
32_bj,Monica98,2020-01-12,5,Girl scout thin mints the ice cream!,0,0,If you're craving girl scout cookies but they're out of season you should buy this instead. Because this is EXACTLY like an ice cream version of thin mints. This is the first mint chocolate ice cream I have ever enjoyed and the chocolate ice cream is so rich with the perfect hint of mint. A new favorite of mine and my husband's! That says a lot since we exclusively buy Ben and Jerry's for ice cream
32_bj,Jenni from the block,2019-03-23,5,Melt in Mouth Madness!!,0,0,"I noticed this flavor around the holidays and have been hooked ever since!! Prior to this I liked the S'more and Boom-Choco-Latta, but nothing like Minter Wonderland. It has a smooth dark chocolate with a back lining of mint, and the cookie and marshmallow make for a great texture in between. You really outdid yourselves this time guys!!"
32_bj,Missylav,2018-12-08,5,Amazing,1,1,"Perfect balance of mint, chocolate and marshmallow!"
32_bj,Lann,2020-01-02,5,The ultimate in decadence,0,0,"The rich, velvety, delectably dark chocolate ice cream is a delight in and of itself. Pair it with gooey marshmallow swirls and crumbly chocolate cookies and you begin to gaze into perfection. My only wish is for it to be more readily available... It's hard to find where I live and I have to drive a ways to find it."
32_bj,Needthis,2020-01-26,5,NEVER LET THIS GO,0,0,"The pinnacle of ice cream achievement. All other flavors pale in comparison. Ben, Jerry, please, I am on my knees begging you to keep this flavor available year-round. I promise you there is a market. Heck, I will eat enough annually to BE the market. This is the only flavor for me."
32_bj,Marly,2019-01-09,5,Tops my list of B&J favorites!,0,0,I've been a Ben & Jerry's fan since day one and have tasted most of their flavors. This exclusive flavor is one of the most sublime flavors they've ever done. It's practically pause-the-TV good and I wish it was brought into the regular rotation because it's amazing.
32_bj,tuni2,2020-09-18,5,Favorite Ever!,0,0,I tried this last year after finding it at target to try it out and it has became my all time favorite ice cream ever. But I haven’t been able to find it for the last few months so have been pretty disappointed. Hope to find it again soon!
32_bj,Sharper90,2019-01-02,5,One of my faves,0,0,This is one of my favorites ! I’ve tried about 25 different Ben and Jerry’s and usually don’t buy a flavor twice. But I really like this one and would buy it again. It’s super rich and has the perfect amount of mint. And I don’t usually like mint ice cream
32_bj,mikeyb,2019-10-26,5,One of the most amazing things ever,0,0,"Genuinely, this flavor will change the way you look at and eat ice cream. I've written to ben and jerry's to beg this be in stores year round. Dark chocolate ice cream with the perfect amount of chunks is hard to find. This is such gold and I adore it."
32_bj,dearkat58,2020-03-30,5,Discovered by accident,0,0,"We discovered this by accident, a whim to look at ice cream that day. Brought it home and loved it. Gone back twice for more. I just wish our local supermarket carried it. Had to go to a Target, which is less convenient."
32_bj,skylarrrr,2019-04-01,4,So good!,0,0,I just came upon this flavor recently & fell in love! It’s better than I expected. Not too much mint but just enough & the marshmallow makes it even better! This is definitely a new favorite for me.

32_bj,Bridget,2019-01-03,5,Best Ice Cream Ever!!,0,0,I bought this ice cream yesterday and I have literally never loved an ice cream more. Half-baked used to be my all time favorite but this takes the cake. Can't get enough!

33_bj,Katz,2018-09-09,5,Bring it back to Norway!,13,0,"I love this flavour most of all ice cream brands and/or flavours out there. I used to buy it whenever I landed at the airport (back to school) after Christmas vacation up North in Norway, back in the day when it still was sold here. Now they have discontinued this flavour for some unknown reason (it can't be due to consumer preferance- I'm sure!!!) and allthough there are a lot of good ice cream out there, it is just not the same without the super chunky rich chocolate flavour of B&J's New York Super fudge chunk. Can someone please tell my disinformed country to BRING IT BACK??! Thank you. Cincerely yours (having withdrawal symptoms as we speak)"
33_bj,tangel,2019-04-11,5,Best Ice Cream I have ever Eaten,9,0,"I look for this Ice Cream in every store I go in to but there are never ANY of them. There are places near us who sell Ben and Jerry's but never type. WalMart - South Charleston, WV and Kroger, Danville, WV are two locations in between where we live. The WalMart gets a lot of traffic and I know it would sell well there. PLEASE help a sister out. I have lost 100 lbs in the last few years and this is my treat to myself but I can never find it anywhere. It is the BEST Ice Cream in all of the LAND .. please, please send some to those locations lol."

33_bj,Twacy,2017-10-01,5,Perfection!,6,0,This has been my favorite for a long time. I love the chocolate ice cream. I would like to see more flavors with this yummy ice cream as the base. I also look forward to the white chocolate and chocolate covered nuts.
33_bj,Dustybucket,2017-11-07,5,New York Super Fudge chunk,5,0,"This is a great tasting ice cream I love the chocolate and nuts in it. I am originally from New York State, so this is a very fitting ice cream for me.
This is also my very favorite Ben and Jerry’s flavor."
33_bj,NYSFC Lover,2017-05-07,5,The BEST flavor!,8,1,"Been a fan since its debut! The very best chocolate ice cream as the base, with tons of chocolate chunks and nuts to keep it exciting. We come back to this flavor every time and have never been disappointed"
33_bj,Mazzarox,2020-03-01,5,Incredible ice cream!,2,0,This is without a doubt my all time favourite ice cream. I used to love phish food but then I discovered New York super fudge chunk and have never looked back. Not just my favourite Ben & Jerry’s ice cream but my favourite ice cream. The chocolate is divine and all the different chunks are really what makes it so special. It’s just a shame that it’s so hard to come by at times and I am terrified that one day it might get discontinued. I might just have to buy in bulk now and save up just in case!
33_bj,KatL,2019-01-27,5,Perfectly Super,3,0,In my opinion this is the best flavor by far. It is so fun to find a chocolate covered nut and chocolate chips. I am not a white chocolate fan but this ice cream is super chocolatey and the while chocolate really complements it. It is super chocolate! And it is so hard to find in stores it is always sold out. Maybe it should move up in the ranks of the favorite flavors.

33_bj,AnabolicAlbert,2020-06-19,5,The best.,1,0,"I’ve bought this several times going to see a movie, the textures and complex profiles of buttery-rich savory flavors leaves a satisfying experience for someone who doesn’t typically indulge in sweets and desserts. The level of variety of textures in this is really an enjoyable experience unlike other ice creams that try to work in nuts or chunks of chewables that really feel like a hindrance to the chewing aspect, but not this. No. This is done right and there is nothing more that could be improved upon. Love this!"

For all of us chunk loving chocolate fanatics who don't want their ice cream cut with marshmallows, or unchocolatified by caramel, this is paradise in the mouth. Please never discontinue this flavor!! I say this not because I live in New York. I'd love it if it were Wyoming or Rhode Island Super Fudge Chunk. I say it because it must be said."

I have tried other flavors of B&J and while they are good, this one knocks my socks off everytime.

Sadly this flavor is not as great. I've had it twice now and both times I was disappointed by the large amount of chocolate flakes versus actual oatmeal cinnamon cookies. The only thing that was right about this was the brown sugar base does taste like the cinnamon base from the original flavor. Anyway, I digress... It'll have to do since it's the closest they've gotten to resurrecting the Oatmeal Cookie Chunk. Just please less fudge flakes or you guys might as well change the name...."
34_bj,maque,2020-02-23,1,Augh I'd LOVE to have this without chocolate :(,4,1,"Everything about this is great - the oatmeal cookie hunks, the cinnamon butter sugar brown I'm getting tongue tied just thinking about it - but I loathe chocolate. I feel like a good oatmeal cookie doesn't have chocolate in it - reserve that for the chocolate chip fans out there. But I tried this anyway, figuring the chocolate might be limited enough I could just grimace and get through it, but nope :( The chocolate was more apparent than the oatmeal cookie itself. This one was just an extra stab in the heart because I was holding out hope that the chocolate chunks were less common than they are in the Cherry Garcia."
34_bj,LaDina,2018-04-12,5,Bomb.com,2,1,"Alli can say is heaven lol. My all time favorite has alwaya been chunkey monkey mostly because of the delicious chunks of chocolate in the ice cream now i found another favorite which is this oat of this swirled. Im sorry to say but the other reviewers who are complaining are picky and can not compare or expect this to be the same as other past sinilar flavors. All in all the chocolate chunks with a cinnamon taste which fully satisfies my cravings. I have one problem though, once i start i can’t stop lol. Overall ben and jerry’s always comes through the right way.! Love ben and jerry’s! No im not sponsered (but i wish i was) ha!"

Imagine my surprise when I saw a new oatmeal flavor was introduced. I quickly purchased it and enjoyed it, but did notice there were not very many cookies chunks. Unfortunately ever since, I have not been able to find this flavor anywhere! All of my local retailers have plenty of urban burban and truffle kerfuffle - but no oat of this swirled anywhere in sight! I am having nightmares of this flavor being taken away again!

34_bj,Juls,2017-05-31,4,Where's the Oatmeal Cookie??,3,0,"I was SO excited when they brought this flavor back to the shelves. I missed the Oatmeal Cookie Chuck (my absolutely all time favorite flavor) oh so much. But the excitement soon was lost when I realized it was not the same OCC I loved so much. There was no chunks of cookies in the ice cream, and I know it's supposed to be a swirl, but 1) it would actually be out of this world if there were the original OCC chunks in it and 2) there was hardly any oatmeal cookie swirl in it. I've bought it a few more times hoping that the production has gotten better with adding more of the oatmeal cookie, but nothing has changed. Very sad. I just wish they could add in the cookie chunks in it like they do for milk and cookies (but oatmeal of course). :("

I came across a Facebook post about it helping another mom with her breastmilk supply, and decided to try it because I was breastfeeding at the time, but wasn't really expecting it to help. I really just wanted to try it because of the flavors lol. I've been kinda disappointed lately though because I always bought this flavor from Walmart or Food Lion, and I guess they've stopped carrying it because I've been in multiple locations for each store and none have it anymore. I had to make a trip across town to Target to get it because I was craving it smh"

Not gonna lie, it's good enough that I (shamefully, and maybe a little drunkenly) was compelled to steal a small spoonful after a late night out. The brown sugar base is just so rich, that when paired with the oat cookies, you just feel all warm and cozy. Like grandma just visited, minus the raisins. It has chocolate flakes though, which have just enough bitterness to them that you're not overwhelmed by the buttery base. Safe to say after my dip into thievery had passed (and I had a 12 hour nap) I went and got my own pint. Sorry girlie! It only happened once I swear."

I can’t stop thinking about it though, after I tried it I haven’t seen it stocked in a store since then, and I literally look EVERY day so I can buy them all up. If it was regularly stocked I would be eating this 3 times a week at least it’s that good. It’s so buttery and perfectly sweet, but the chocolate and cinnamon flavors add the perfect amount of savory to balance everything out. I can’t help but think how awesome it would be with the cookie dough pieces added to it as well if I was feeling really indulgent. I wish I could get my hands on this stuff again."

Honestly the huge chunks of fudge makes me gag . I end up picking them out after 2.... I was expecting a lot more oatmeal cookie. I think it would really be ""Oat of this swirled"" if you added just a bit more oatmeal cookie, took about a 1/4 of the fudge chucks and shaved them instead. That sounds perfect to me. Please alert me when these changes have been implemented. Thanks so much❣"
34_bj,Allen,2017-09-03,2,"Good, but...",1,1,"I had high hopes for this flavor when I saw it in the freezer case. I thought the brown sugar ice cream base was really good as was the oatmeal cinnamon swirls, but for me it was ruined by the excessive amount of fudge flakes, which to me really aren't flakes but more like chunks. There were just too many that I ended up tasting more of the fudge than anything else and eventually had to eat around them. I think at least half as many fudge flakes could have been used and still served it's purpose. I'd likely only buy it again if I knew there was less flakes in it."

Oatmeal Cookie was my all time favorite ice cream before it was pulled, and so I immediately purchased this when I saw this in the store. But, the cookie definitely did not have any of the amazing chunks I was expecting, and to further disappoint, barely had any traces/flavoring swirled in at all. The base was good (and maybe even an improvement on the Oatmeal Cookie!), but it really did not make up for the lack of cookie. Oh Ben and Jerrys, why do you tease me so?!"

Unfortunately it doesn't quite stack up. The flavor is really good but I was disappointed to see that it was just a swirl of cookie (if you can call it that, my pint barely had any) and not more substantial chunks. I miss being able to taste chunks of delicious oatmeal cookies in my ice cream."
34_bj,FuzzyGut,2018-08-02,5,Excellent flavor,2,0,A nearly perfect pint. There were TONS of fudge chips in this one and the cookie swirl was dense and super yummy. The ice cream didn’t scream ‘buttery brown sugar’ though. It’s really good tasting ice cream and you do get a hint of those flavors but it could have been coming off the cookie swirl as easily. But that’s a small issue and it really is a great tasting pint which I will definitely buy again!

Wasn’t I disappointed when the ice cream I found inside the container was missing more than half of the ingredients listed in the ice cream’s description. No oatmeal cookie swirl nor buttery brown sugar ice cream. Just a very flat tasting white ice cream with bittersweet chocolate flakes. I’m wondering how many other containers of this flavor are floating around with missing ingredients and whether or not B&J is aware of it? Here are photos that prove I’m not crazy!"

34_bj,CookieLover598,2019-12-21,5,Amazing!,1,0,I love this flavor so much! The base has a lot of tasty cinnamon and I agree with other reviewers that there are a ton of chocolate fudge flakes but I actually like them because they seem to be darker chocolate and they balance all the sweetness and richness of the buttery ice cream and cookie swirl. I also love the texture of the swirl--it's a little gritty (in a good way) and super sweet. All around amazing flavor!

But when I want ice cream too I'm pushing it. Oat of This Swirled is the answer to my prayers! The brown sugar ice cream base is simply delicious on its own. Sweet and creamy without ever tasting too heavy. The oat taste comes in just afterward with a warm and rich note. The chocolate chips in addition to all this really ties it together. Amazing! Please keep this flavor around!!!

I’ve never been a big Ben and Jerry’s fan (mostly because I thought it was overpriced and just didn’t buy it) but I’ve splurged too many times buying this stuff.

That said, if OCC tasted anything like Oat of this Swirled, NO WONDER fans have been begging for its return for so long. This flavor is absolutely delicious! The swirl perfectly captures that baked cinnamon and oat taste you'd expect from the cookie but without any oats as far as I can tell. The buttery brown sugar base, which has always been one of B&J's best, perfectly compliments the swirl, cementing the cookie theme in taste. And the fudge flakes, while a bit strong, add a nice contrast."

I like the cinnamon, I like the chocolate chunks, but I miss the oatmeal cookie bits, and despise what they've done with the brown sugar. It kind of melts and sticks to the ice-cream creating this texture that reminds me of cookie dough. This is at something I never enjoyed. And the flavor is kind of like a butter-scotch. Also not for me. What is 'for me' is gone; The oatmeal cookie without any of this gooey gross stuff that reminds me of every other gimmicky approach Ben and Jerry's takes with their icecream. I may be in the minority but the only flavor they ever made that I like is gone. My taste buds may be in a minority but that is the way the cookie crumbles."

I wanted to love it; I am 90-95% dairy-free but made an exception for this. Won't eat the rest of the pint."
34_bj,treasure hunter,2018-08-03,5,I hunger for more,0,0,"I bought a pint a week after I broke my arm. Even after 10 sequential pints this flavor doesn't get old. I must admit I even ate it for breakfast. The only disappointing aspect of this product is the lack of its presence on my local grocery stores' shelves. My arm healed quickly and is now strong, I accredit this to the hope packaged in a pint. Thank you from my past, present, and future self."

Since trying oat of this swirled, I have found my favorite flavor. I love the slight caramel flavor of the ice cream, and the chocolate chunks that perfectly balance the cinnamon cookie swirl. The only crunch I got was from the chocolate chunks, which was the perfect balance of crunchy and creamy. Soo good!!"
34_bj,ktski2,2017-10-25,5,MMMM Brown Sugar,0,0,"Greatness was popularized with the takeover of overnight Oats. Oats and Oatmeal cookies have always been a favorite of mine, but have been scoffed at for most of my life. THey have typically been thought of as Grandma cookies because they likely contain raisin. Ben & Jerry's did this cookie justice by adding large chocolate chunks and capitalizing on the cookies brown sugary goodness."
34_bj,Smands,2017-05-25,4,"I do love this a lot, but...",0,0,"I was obsessed, absolutely obsessed with the oatmeal cookie chunk, and Oat of this swirled has nearly mended my broken oatmeal/cinnamon loving heart. I've had this 4 or 5 times now and there's hardly much of a cookie swirl at all. Maybe I'm just having bad luck, but mine have had little to no cookie. You really need to beef it up, and this flavor would truly be out of this world!!"
34_bj,mrshouston,2017-12-06,4,Love it!,0,0,I stumbled upon the Oatmeal Cookie Crumble or Crunch and was so sad when it randomly disappeared. I've been looking here and there to see if they brought it back. I found this yesterday while at Target and my heart smiled. It's yummy! Would love more oatmeal cookie pieces but overall I love it. I'm going to buy more. So if you'd like to bring back the original that would be GREAT to.
34_bj,sashak,2019-05-05,5,THE MOST DELICIOUS ICE CREAM ON THE PLANET,0,0,"Oat of this swirled is seriously out of this world! This is my favorite ice cream of all time. The abundance of snappy chocolate flakes! And the oaty, cinnamony swirls! YUM! I just wish this was carried in more stores! Luckily they've been stocking it at my nearby Star Market in Somerville, MA, but I have yet to see it in any corner stores or drug stores. I'm a forever fan!"
34_bj,VaBelleinTN,2019-01-10,5,I LOVE this stuff.,0,0,"So, years ago another ice cream brand made a flavor called Oatmeal Cookie. You could only get it in their ice cream shops (at least where I live) and I was obsessed with it. Sadly it disappeared around 2014. When I saw this in stores, I got excited because it sounded like the same ice cram and it pretty much is. It is sooooo good. Please don't even stop making this flavor."
34_bj,Dr Bob,2017-06-17,4,Needs less chocolate chunks and more oatmeal swirl,1,1,"There's just too many chocolate chunks in this ice cream it tends to overpower the ice cream itself. It needs more of the cookie bits instead. Also, how about raisins?"
34_bj,Hondaman247,2019-10-01,4,Good but still not oatmeal cookie chunk,0,0,"I like this ice cream and it's close to my all time favorite oatmeal cookie chunk. Everytime I go to the store I go to the ice cream isle hopefully to find the best ice cream of all time, oatmeal cookie chunk. I've been doing this since Ben and Jerry's stop making it. I just wish you guys would stop messing with my ice cream emotions and make oatmeal cookie chunk again."

I'm an oatmeal cookie monster, its my favorite! and this flavor hits it on the head!! The brown sugar ice cream and the mixture of oatmeal cookie dough and then to top it with the chocolate chips.... literally amazing!! I hope this flavor doesn't go anywhere because this is delish!!"

I'm very picky with ice cream flavors, but I'm a huge fan of brown sugar and I love how it's incorporated into this flavor. ""Oat of This Swirled"" really is out of this world.... It's heavenly! I'm hoping the grocery store keeps selling this flavor forever because I plan on buying it over and over again."

I've never had an oatmeal cookie with chocolate in it and don't like the combo. I pick them out. I like chocolate....I like oatmeal cookie but not together!
34_bj,SarahSS,2017-11-08,5,SO much better than I expected!,0,0,"I was craving ice cream but B&J's was pretty much wiped out at my local grocery store. This was one of the only flavors left, but it's not something I'd typically go for. I got it anyway and oh my goodness, I'm so glad I did!!! It is so delicious, from the flavor of the brown sugar ice cream to the chocolate and cookie swirls. Will definitely purchase again."

One thing I suggest is not adding so many chocolate chip chunks, it kind of got in the way of the brown sugar buttery oatmeal cookies ice cream I was trying to enjoy. Eventually started picking them out of the ice cream, other than that, great flavor"

I couldn't believe that you brought something back similar to oatmeal cookie chunk. Even though that flavor was retired, I still went looking for it. Made my trip to the jersey shore worth it today!

There is nothing Oat of this Swirled cannot do."

However, I think this has quickly become my new favorite flavor, and I've been a ride or die for Cherry Garcia for half my life. The buttery brown sugar ice cream part is the perfect background for the chunks of chocolate and swirls of sweet cinnamon"
34_bj,Knowitall,2018-04-22,5,From yours truly addicted,0,0,"I can’t stop eating this ice cream. As a former scooper, I would think I would get sick of it but nope I keep coming back for more. I do agree with the earlier reviewers suggestion - more cookie swirl less chocolate chunks. The chunks are quite large and overwhelm the taste of the ice cream and the cookie mix. It hasn’t stopped me yet though."
34_bj,Cjh25,2020-06-07,4,Sweet tooth satisfying!,0,0,"I wasn’t looking to try a new flavor but this one peaked my taste buds and oh my gosh, so good, so perfectly blended. I saw a lot of complaints about too much chocolate but I love the bitterness and crunch of the chocolate. It balances out the sweet cinnamon and brown sugar. Overall one of the best flavors! Creamy, crunchy and sweet!"
34_bj,AJK97,2019-04-07,5,Amazing,0,0,I’ve tried many flavors but this one by far is the best. I personally think there needs to be a little more cookie pieces but don’t overdo it all of the components complement each other so well. I hope this ice cream stays as a “forever flavor”. Everybody loves it so much it’s the first flavor to sell out in my town in all stores. ❤️

Enjoy every bite like it’s your last."

The brown sugar base was delicious and such a unique flavor. However, I was disappointed by the large amount of chocolate flakes versus actual oatmeal cinnamon cookies. It made the overall flavor more chocolatey than the cinnamon/brown sugar flavor I was hoping for."
34_bj,Chelshay,2017-05-18,5,My favorite!,0,0,I love this flavor! I loved the Oatmeal cookie chunk flavor that they discontinued awhile back and was always so sad they got rid of it. When I saw this flavor and knew it was a lot like the old one I was so happy!!! My husband and I love it and can't put the tub down till it's empty haha please never get rid of this flavor!
34_bj,ariicecream5,2017-10-24,5,The greatest of them all,0,0,"Oat of this Swirled has all the elements . . . it's got those classic B&J chocolate chunks, it's got those perfect cookie bites, it's got a nice, subtle, creamy base, it's got swirls of sugary deliciousness. I LOVE THIS FLAVOR! It's unseated Chunky Monkey after maybe half a decade as my FAVORITE OF THEM ALL!"
34_bj,Brianna,2020-05-02,3,"No cookie, lots of chocolate",0,0,There is barely any oatmeal cookie in this ice cream which is really disappointing since Ben and Jerry’s always has lots of good stuff in their ice cream. There are WAY TO many big pieces of fudge flakes. I was so upset I MADE MY OWN OATMEAL COOKIES TO SWIRL IN!!! When you do get a rare piece of cookie it is good.
34_bj,McCaulley Culkin,2018-08-15,5,Best Flavor in the World!,0,0,It is my favorite ice cream flavor of all time. BUT I do think that there needs to be more oatmeal cookie chunks and less fudge chips - or at least make the fudge chips smaller. Definitely more cookie chunks though! But it is delicious and if you ever stop making it.. I. WILL. NEVER. FORGIVE. YOU. BEN. & JERRY. :)

If Jesus got bored with plants and animals and peoples and decided to make an ice cream, it would be brown sugar. Beyoncé named the twins after this flavor. This was Victoria's Secret. I don't even like Oats and this ice cream still gave me a reason to live. Amen."
34_bj,Baby,2020-06-28,2,Too much fudge,0,0,"I just bought this because I like the idea of oatmeal cookies in ice cream, but every spoonful was just fudge flakes. The ice cream itself is very good, but there are simply too many fudge flakes. I can understand putting a few in for texture, but this just made the ice cream too crunchy and was a disappointment."
34_bj,PhantomFears685,2017-10-01,5,Serious Love,0,0,"This ice cream tastes like someone took an oatmeal cookie and made it into ice cream without being overbearing with the oatmeal or the cinnamon. Then, just for fun, they put chocolate in it."
34_bj,lunedeclaire,2018-06-10,5,The. Best.,0,0,I am loving this flavor so much: the oatmeal cookie chunks paired with the slabs of chocolate are just perfect. Is this flavor being discontinued? I am not able to find it as much as I used to be able to!

I love this! I've bought it 3 different times now. Each time it's a bit of a surprise to see what the fudge flake to cookie swirl ratio is and I kind of enjoy that.

34_bj,rledoux,2018-03-26,5,New Favorite Ice Cream,0,0,This is hands down the best ice cream flavor Ben & Jerry's has. The oat meal cookie dough swirls with chocolate chunks mixed with the brown sugar ice cream makes for an unbeatable combination. This is like everything I love wrapped up in an ice cream flavor!

34_bj,brandi3,2017-04-25,5,FINALLY A REPLACEMENT,0,0,I absolutely loved the Ben and Jerry's Oatmeal Cookie Chunk ice cream. Definitely the best flavor of all time! I'm so glad there's finally a replacement. Oat of This Swirled is so close to the old flavor and does not disappoint. Happy to say I've finally got my favorite ice cream back!
34_bj,aidenborealis,2019-08-24,5,About to Be Discontinued?,0,0,What happened? This flavor is nowhere to be found. I checked the locator and no stock is found within a 100 mile radius. I live in a big city so this is kind of ridiculous! Please start stocking this flavor again! It was bad enough that you had to discontinue Oatmeal Cookie Chunk.

34_bj,Jade,2017-11-10,5,A Keeper!,0,0,All in all an oat-standing flavor that meets the need I didn't know I had for oats in ice cream. Even my roommate with impossibly high ice cream standards said this might be one of her favorite Ben & Jerry's flavors! I just wish there was twice as much swirl!

35_bj,BJLUVER,2017-10-04,5,Peanut butter goodness,8,0,"Now you have to be in a peanut butter mood to have this ice cream, but when you are, it's the best. I'm impressed. It would be easy to make the rookie mistake of going for the cream when you're only feeling somewhat ~nutty~ but this is a flavor that makes you commit. So before you purchase, ask yourself, am I feeling nuts enough for this today? If the answer is yes, then taking home a pint of this ice cream will probably be the best decision you make all day. This is not necessarily my favorite flavor, but it is a fantastic one."
35_bj,Jackie3,2020-04-17,3,Good flavor but big chunks,2,4,Love the peanut butter flavor but the peanut butter cups are too big. They should be more broken up. With them being so big it makes it overpowering.
35_bj,FuzzyGut,2018-05-28,5,Peanut butter cup magic,2,0,"What can I say about this one? It’s a simple concoction: peanut butter ice cream loaded with little peanut butter cups, and it is SUBLIME! As per usual, the ice cream flavor and texture are perfect and the pb cups are also. It’s also very dense and heavy so you feel good n’ full after you polish off a full pint (if you manage it). This is one amazing pint that always makes me feel better. I could eat this every night!"
35_bj,Fanny,2019-12-24,5,Thank you for this ice cream,5,1,I love peanut butter ice cream an d an never find it. Peanut butter cups are also my favorite candy. This combination is the absolute best. I hope you consider changing your pint slice to the peanut butter ice cream instead of the vanilla.
35_bj,angelofsa,2017-07-09,5,WOW,6,1,Addict since the first time i tasted. WAY TOO PERFECT!!!
35_bj,Kelltini5,2017-07-02,5,My favorite!!,3,0,"If you love peanut butter, this is the one for you!! Sometimes there's not enough peanut butter cups, but the peanut butter ice cream is good all on it's own."
35_bj,yaacov,2017-07-19,4,Great flavour!,3,4,"Really enjoyed this flavour of ice cream! though I have to say that the peanut butter cups were usually whole or half... I think quarters would prob be better as they would be distributed more evenly through out the pint and allow more ice cream to be eaten with them.
Also, I love the fact that because it's peanut butter, I (personally) can't eat a whole pint in one go, so it makes pace it out and last longer (very important in exam period) :)"
35_bj,Pietro,2017-09-15,5,The absolute best,3,1,"This is as good as it gets. My absolute favorite B&J flavor, as well as probably my favorite flavor of icecream. It broke my heart when they stopped producing it in my country."
35_bj,Intcel,2018-04-05,5,Love it!,1,0,I am addicted to this ice cream. The only negative thing I can come up with is when there are too many butter cup chunks are in the same pot. They are just too hard and too sweet to be eaten without a sufficient amount of that smooth and mild peanut ice cream.
35_bj,richy,2017-09-11,5,smooth and delicious,1,0,"After trying the magnum peanut butter flavour last week, I had to try this and its just as good! Smmoth peanut butter gives texture to the ice cream (and you can still taste the cream!) and the chunky chocolate gives the contrast."

35_bj,DC24,2018-09-04,5,Peanut Buttery Goodness!,0,0,"One of my all time favorite ice creams, which is saying a lot because I usually do not go for peanut butter ice creams! The perfect blend of chocolate and peanut butter. Unlike most peanut butter cup ice cream flavors, they do not skimp on the peanut butter cup pieces. There are generous hunks of peanut butter cup throughout the pint! If you like peanut butter cups and you like ice cream, then you should definitely give this one a try."
35_bj,IceCreamConnoisseur,2017-11-12,3,"Ratio off, HUGE PB cups. Still yummy.",1,3,"The packaging of this product reflects that the peanut butter cups are chopped up and distributed evenly. The pint I got had huge PB cups, like they were only chopped in half once and they were all near the top. Now this wasnt a terrible thing but sadly as we got past the halfway point there was no more delicious chocolate PB cups for us to enjoy. Made the last of it disappointing."
35_bj,Marenghi,2017-06-26,2,Peanut butter cups too large,5,14,"The picture on the pint shows chopped up peanut butter cups distributed throughout the ice cream, but the pints I've tried had full or halved pieces in the middle of the pint and no smaller pieces throughout. Not a good mix-in."
35_bj,linds,2017-05-11,5,"Great flavor, not enough cups",1,1,"I bought this expecting a lot of peanut butter cups like I received the last three times I bought the product, but was disappointed when there were barely any. The ice cream was still very tasty, but it was a slight let down."
35_bj,Bri L,2019-02-02,5,Best flavor ever!,0,0,"I continue to buy this flavor, it's amazing! The balance of peanut butter ice cream to large chunks of PB cup pieces makes this masterpiece true perfection! I am not a huge peanut butter fan, but from this first time I tried it, I knew I was hooked. This is the only ice cream I buy! Good job Ben &Jerry for making the best (in my opinion), flavor in the whole world! Two thumbs up and 5 stars!!!"

Purchased from Charlies in Bassendean . Very grainy/ gritty. Perhaps had been thawed & refrozen. Bugger, Sue loves those boutique icecreams & this one missed the mark"
35_bj,cupcake1221,2020-06-07,5,Delicious!,0,0,"This is definitely one of my favorite ice cream flavors! The peanut butter ice cream has the perfect sweetness to it, and the peanut butter flavor is not too overpowering. I personally enjoy the larger chunks of peanut butter cups mixed with the smaller chunks. It is overall very delicious!"
35_bj,WorldPeace,2019-04-07,5,Mouthwatering!,0,0,"I’ve never been a huge fan of peanut butter, but Ben and Jerry, you did it again. When I took my first chunky scoop- Pure. Magic. Creamy, chunky, and chocolatey all rolled into one. I do recommend a chocolate swirl just so it’s balanced out. Otherwise, delicious."

Peanut butter ice cream with generous sized chunks of peanut butter cups. They taste super delicious too! The best."
35_bj,Kitty87,2019-04-07,5,Too good to keep in the house!,0,0,I lose all control around this ice cream. I have to be careful about having it in the house because sometimes I can't stop myself from eating the whole pint in one sitting. It is so balanced and perfectly sweet. Well done Ben and Jerry!
35_bj,Mek0060,2018-05-20,5,Delicious!,0,0,"I hadn't had Ben & Jerry's in years. My husband brought home several different pints last night and OH WOW the peanut buttery, creamy indulgence of Peanut butter cup! I'm not even a big ice cream fan but this flavor is my new weakness!"
35_bj,,2020-08-11,5,Give me the PB Cups!!!,0,0,I have GOT to know how to get my hands on JUST the pb cups. They’re so much better than Reese’s cups And those are my favorite guilty pleasure. I buy the icecream just so I can pick the cups out and eat just them! Ha
35_bj,amyjo,2019-08-27,5,Peanut Butter Cup Heaven!,0,0,"One of my top favorite go-to flavors! Each pint I've purchased is jammed packed with peanut butter cups. The cups have a nice balance of chocolate and peanut butter, which gives it a nice chocolate crunch texture."
35_bj,nnarely,2020-06-06,5,Absolute Favorite,0,0,This is the ice cream flavor that really sold me on Ben and Jerry’s. The ice cream is sweet and peanut buttery and then there’s just loads of chocolatey peanut butter cups. The ratio is just perfect.
35_bj,Marky,2019-04-16,2,Disappointing quality for the price,0,2,"A bit artificial flavor. Very powdery. Tastes like a not very good processed powder milk with just a hint of peanut taste.
Chocolate bits to big.
However, not the worst ice cream I’ve had."

35_bj,Melposer012,2018-01-23,1,Pint,0,13,I had a whole pint with not one peanut butter cup. Plus it was so grainy. It was like it had thawed and been frozen again several times...

I finally found some at the 3rd Target but was fully prepared to go to a 4th if necessary. THAT is how good this ice cream is!! The chocolate is rich, the peanut butter is perfectly blended in but then you get COOKIES TOO?? It just makes your mouth happy! I was addicted from the first spoonful and buy it in 3's whenever I find it. I almost hate to tell people about it because then it's less for me!!! Don't ever stop making it or we will be picketing in front of your factory!! LOL"
36_bj,Kdub,2018-01-01,5,BEST ICE CREAM EVERRRRRRR,10,0,NOTHING ELSE MATTERS. TARGET RUNS OUT. HELP! RUINED FOR ALL OTHER ICE CREAM
36_bj,Phish Food Fan,2018-10-29,3,Good flavor but ...,12,2,"This is a tough one for me. I’ve tried 3 pints of this and the flavor is great. The chocolate ice cream base is perfect. It’s rich and creamy. The flavor of peanut butter and cookie swirls is also really really good. My problem is with how hard the swirls are. In my 3 pints, they were so hard that I could barely crack them with my spoon and they come out in one really big mass which makes eating the ice cream a bit of a wrestling match. But it all tastes SO good! It’s really decedent and rich and extremely filling. I will continue to buy it, I just wish it was easier to eat."
36_bj,FuzzyGut,2020-02-16,1,Why does this keep happening?!,24,25,"So this is the second pint of a peanut butter focused flavor (the first being peanut buttah core) where the swirls are rock hard and jammed in the middle of the pint! I don’t get it. I have had countless Ben and Jerry’s pints and most have been perfect but I have to admit this is really starting to bother me! It isn’t supposed to be this way. I don’t to stop exploring new flavors but I feel like maybe I should just stick to my tried-and-true favorites. I’m sorry to be a downer but I’m really not happy that 2 out of 2 peanut butter pints had inedible swirls and cores! I usually give gushing, glowing reviews on here and I’m not a hard to please jerk. I just want ice cream I can eat."

36_bj,Paulb2112,2019-03-11,5,Greatest I’ve Cream Flavor Ever?,0,0,"Yes. I can’t stop eating this even though I promised I was done with ice cream.

If ur a peanut butter, chocolate with a cookie crunch person this is the best combo to date"
36_bj,fishdork74,2017-12-18,5,Simply Wonderful!,4,1,"What a wonderful combination! I thought you couldn't beat the combination of chocolate and peanut butter, but you totally did when you added chocolate cookie swirls to the mix. Thank you! Please keep making this flavor, it is my favorite by far!"

Perfect blend of chocolate and peanut butter are delicious, and the PB swirls are exactly what I’ve been looking for. No other company makes an ice cream flavor like this. I have been buying it every time I go to Target. In fact it has increased my overall ice cream sales significantly. Thank you!! Please keep this flavor in circulation."

36_bj,JennA,2017-08-09,5,Best Ice Cream Ever!,2,0,I got this randomly when I was at target one day and I'm in love! Hands down the best chocolate peanut butter ice cream ever. I do usually get it at target because it's cheaper there... but the grocery store next to my house does sell it!
36_bj,NLK1,2018-02-01,5,OMG - Beyond Yummy,2,0,This is a MUST. I tried it for the first time about a month ago. I've been looking for it ever since. EUREKA!!! I found it again yesterday and bought two. I so love this flavor! THANK YOU for being so wonderful.
36_bj,LibrarianLynn,2017-06-08,5,Wowza!,2,0,SO good! I would make a special trip to Target just to get this. VERY glad that B&J resisted putting hard chunks in this flavor like they do in so many of their flavors. This is rich and chewy and perfect.
36_bj,Mackkwalkk,2018-01-09,5,Awesome,2,0,"I love all Ben and Jerry’s and this is my absolute favorite! I’ve been stocking up since it’s an exclusive. I would hate to see this flavor go, definitely should be added to the list of full time flavors!!"
36_bj,EDVaughn,2018-06-21,5,Best Ben and Jerry’s Flavor,2,0,And it’s not even close! Just wish it was everywhere instead of just at Target. Three times I have planned on making it last multiple evenings. All three times I finished the whole pint in one sitting.
36_bj,Bruce,2017-05-25,5,Absolutely perfect!!!!,2,0,"This might be the best flavor of ice cream ever!! Please consider selling it at non Target locations so everyone can get their hands on this! At the very least, don't stop selling it there!"
36_bj,Peanut Butter Lover,2018-10-28,1,Misleading Flavor Name,6,25,"How can this flavor be called ""Peanut Butter World"" when 2 out of the 3 ingredients listed in the description of the ice cream are chocolate? And in the ice cream itself, it's 95% chocolate. Is this a joke? The title makes no sense. Where's the peanut butter in this peanut butter world? The description says ""Milk Chocolate Ice Cream with Peanut Buttery Swirls & Chocolate Cookie Swirls"". How did you come up with the title from those ingredients? I love Ben & Jerry's ice cream, but y'all put chocolate in almost every flavor, even when it doesn't belong and it's so unnecessary. I love peanut butter flavored everything and most peanut buttery treats aren't peanut buttery enough for me. I just don't like chocolate that much and because of that I was very disappointed with this flavor."
36_bj,You can call me David,2017-04-18,5,This is the. Perfect. Ice. Cream.,2,0,This is the only flavor I buy anymore. It is the epitome of ice cream. I dare anyone to try it and say otherwise.
36_bj,sarahsicecream,2018-10-10,5,"Please never leave me, Peanut Butter World",1,0,"This is my favorite Ben & Jerry's flavor. I go out of my way to Target to buy it and no other ice cream compares. Please make this one full time and expand it to Walmart or something!! It's the perfect combination of salty and sweet, peanut butter and chocolate. The cookie crunch is the icing on the... ice cream. Anyway, it's wonderful."
36_bj,Lashawn,2018-07-02,5,My new best Ben and Jerry's flavor!!!!,1,0,I saw this flavor on the website and went to my local Target to get it. I was in love after my first bite. I love the combination of the peanut butter and rich chocolate ice cream. The cookie swirl is so good! Please don't stop making this flavor. It is one of your best in my opinion. This is my new favorite flavor!
36_bj,Loonat64,2018-01-29,5,Yum!,1,0,It's. So. Good. Definitely the best flavor to come out in a long time! But please make it available in places other than Target. It's inconvenient to get to and they never stock enough of this flavor. Give the people what they want! More Peanut Butter World!
36_bj,Natasha,2017-08-13,5,Perfect Amount of Peanut Butter,1,0,I'm always searching for ice cream with peanut butter and often disappointed by the sparse amounts of peanut butter.

36_bj,Stephbdvm,2020-05-05,5,Amazing,1,0,This is the best ice cream ever. It’s the only flavor I eat. The peanut butter is the very best flavor and the cookie texture is the bomb. I wish it wasn’t exclusive and I could find it more places. Love love love this.
36_bj,Momma J,2020-04-24,5,OMG,1,0,Just found this flavor today and ate the whole pint already. I love Peanut Butter Fudge Core and this is soooo much creamier and the cookies add a nice texture. Please don’t take this one away!!!

From the moment I tried Peanut Butter World, I knew I had found a favorite. What makes it different (and freakin delicious) is the crunch of cookie in every bite. There was a period of time when Target was sold out and I was seriously going through withdrawals! If you love peanut butter, do yourself a favor and try this ice cream. You’re welcome."
36_bj,lauren327,2018-09-11,5,Please don't EVER stop making this!,0,0,"I've been buying this flavor for about three years now, and while I'm not a fan of ice cream typically, this is DIVINE. I buy it 4 canisters at a time at any Target I can find. Some may say it has too much peanut butter in it (or something similarly insane), but this is really the only ice cream on the planet that I enjoy. I only wish I could find it at more places."
36_bj,WickedAnnabella,2020-08-16,5,Best Peanut Butter Swirls!,0,0,"This is the #1 best chocolate-peanut butter ice cream you can buy. Ben & Jerry's other peanut butter ice creams are not as good due to the inclusion of mini peanut butter cups, which lack the peanut butter flavor you get from the swirls in this flavor. As far as I know you can only buy Peanut Butter World at Target, and I've made special trips just for this!"
36_bj,Marisa,2020-04-24,5,Siren's Call,0,0,"Every time I think I have shaken off my love for this ice cream the combination of sweet chocolate and salty peanut butter drags me back in. The chocolate is sweet without being cloying, and the peanut butter offsets that perfectly. This is the ice cream I choose to splurge on (eat an entire container of) for my birthday."
36_bj,Kristenmarie211,2020-04-26,5,By far my favorite flavor,0,0,"My favorite part about Ben & Jerry's is that they don't have corn Syrup in the ingredients. At least not with this flavor. I think their ice cream has remained the same and most wonderful and as corn syrup does horrible things to my skin, Ben & Jerry's gives me the ice cream i crave, without the breakouts."
36_bj,LaLaLady,2020-08-05,5,My new fave flavor,0,0,"im a huge pb fan and this was done so well! Ribbons of peanut butter and then cookie crunchies add delicious texture to the creamy chocolate ice cream. Thanks B&J! Only downside is being exclusive to Target, my first trip there they were out.

It seems as if I can't get enough of the super creamy chocolate ice cream with the heavenly swirls of Marshmallow and Carmel throughout it and the wonderful little bonuses of fudge fish that are so ""chocolatey"" that they quench my desires & cravings!! But then as I start to see my spoon scraping the bottom of the container I rush to my freezer just to make sure I've got 1 more pint of Phish Food in there for later!!! Phish Food has all the ""bells & whistles"" that will please any ice cream chocohlic!!! My final words: Ben and Jerry's Phish Food Ice Cream is DAMNDIDDLYICIOUS!!!!!!! (my made up word for very delicious)"
37_bj,joannenicole89,2018-10-20,5,Still unrivalled as my favourite ice cream,8,0,"I cannot speak more highly of this flavour. I love that it has the perfect balance of both taste and texture: The sweet and soft marshmallow swirls, offset by the mildly bitter and crunchy fudge fish, and tied together with caramel. I usually eat a whole pint on my own, and would save each ""phish"" so I get one in each spoonful towards the end. I always wish there was more! Nevertheless, it's still my favourite flavour, and I hope it doesn't get forgotten or overshadowed by the newer products. This brand is so expensive in my country, but I still save up and buy it as often as I can. It's THAT good."
37_bj,dtk9,2018-05-18,5,Absolutely perfect,10,0,"Sometimes I think, man, Ben and Jerry's is kinda expensive... then I see this flavor on the shelf and I'm ready to go in debt. Let me just say, you guys need to put marshmallows in your ice cream more often (in recipes that make sense of course lol). The texture for this ice cream is wonderful and I really think it's because of the marshmallows. I have never bought Phish Food and been unsatisfied. And the thing is: I don't even care for chocolate ice cream. It's the flavor I always come back to, even when I swear to try something different."

37_bj,Ken 1,2017-10-14,5,My Favorite Flavor!!!,6,2,"One day I was in an extra curricular activity and a friend of mine was placing Phish Food in the freezer. It was a hot day and I am basically okay with any kind of ice cream so I asked if I could have it and she said, 'Sure'. I went and grabbed a plastic spoon from the cabinet, opened the pint, and stuck the spoon in scooping up some ice cream. Before that moment I thought all ice cream was more or less similar. Boy, was I wrong! After tasting that first spoon full, I knew it was the most amazing ice cream I ever tasted!"

37_bj,Jen00,2017-07-21,5,Absolutely Wonderful!,4,2,"Arguably the best Ben and Jerry's flavor, it's possible to eat an entire pint alone and not notice until the spoon scrapes the bottom. It's that good. The little fish are adorable, AND they taste like the best chocolate ever. I wish I could buy them by the bag, their perfectly melt in your mouth amazing. Add the caramel and marshmellow and it's super sweet, but doesn't pass the line of Too Sweet. Much love to Ben & Jerry for their amazing ice cream!"

37_bj,Sadie,2018-11-17,5,Absolutely Exquisite,1,0,"Phish food is the most amazing tasting ice cream I have ever had. Even better than homemade ice cream from the ice cream parlour. The chocolate ice cream base is rich and creamy, with just the perfect amount of marshmallow and caramel swirls. The chocolate fish are amazing, they a a slightly darker flavor than the chocolate ice cream making for a tasty chocolaty combination that is not too sweet, but sweet enough to satisfy my insasasionable craving for chocolate."

This was the first Ben and Jerry's ice cream I ever tried and I have tried others but none compare to this masterpiece. I don't see it in the case everytime I go to the grocery store so whenever I happen to pass by it and notice it's there it's a MUST BUY! The combination of the chocolatey ice cream and thick marshmallow swirls with the fudge fish is enough to send anyone over the edge. Amazing!

He came home with Phish Food and I said: ""naw, I don't think I'll like it. You can eat it."" And then he opened it and shoved it in my hands with a spoon. I tried two bites I was sold.

I have been looking for years to find phish food that does not have Carmel. Everyone I ask insist that it always had caramel in it, which is not true.

37_bj,Baespos,2018-01-18,4,"Very good, very rich",2,6,"This flavor was the first ever flavor I bought of B&J. It is very, very good but very,very rich. I typically only buy this if I am craving chocolate (which I never do, go figure). It's overall, very good but it's so rich. I really wish there was a vanilla option, or maybe a little more Marshmallow swirl to mellow out the chocolate."

Thank you for your Divine Creation."

I catch myself ""phishing"" the container just for the swirls. The fudge fish aren't redundant like you might think they'd be. Excellent flavor."
37_bj,Puck,2018-10-18,5,My go-to flavor,0,0,"Of all the Ben & Jerry's flavors, this is the one that when I'm looking over a grocery store selection and I'm uncertain what to have that I'll most often choose. It's quite sweet between the chocolate ice cream and the caramel, but the addition of the little fish and the creamy marshmallow allow for a very pleasant textural element."

38_bj,DianaCAFLQC,2018-09-23,5,Perfection for Pistachio Lovers!,5,0,"I have had great, mediocre, and yucky ice cream/gelato all around the states and several different countries, and this is by far my very, very all-time favourite as the quality creamy ice cream has a cool subtle pistachio flavour and it is loaded with tons of toasted perfect nuts! What could be better than that? Sadly, I now live in Montreal, and have checked every ice cream selling market/deppaneur/etc. and cannot find this flavour anywhere! I need my fix! This is torture! (....and I don’t understand how we have such a huge French and Italian population here, why this is not one of the few flavours sold here!). :("
38_bj,DianaCAFLYUL,2017-05-30,5,Perfection!,9,1,"This is my all-time favorite store-bought ice cream/flavor! Having been to Italy several times, I've had my share of amazing pistachio gelato. B&J's does it even better as you have the smooth, creamy lightly pistachio-flavored ice cream and lots of toasted pistachios for that great crunch within the creamy......perfection! Sadly, I've never been to a B&J's that offers this flavor, and it is pretty difficult to find in grocery stores and drug stores. So....when you do.....nab them all! :D You're welcome! (.....everyone always thanks me for turning them onto this flavor!)"
38_bj,,2017-10-30,1,Vanilla ice cream with hard pistachio nuts,7,29,"I have high expectations for Ben and Jerry's as they make fantastically wild flavors so when I saw they had a pistachio available I picked it up immediately. Before I even got home from the store I felt assured that I had found my new favorite ice cream (love pistachios), something to rival the pistachio gelato I get from my local coffee shop. Unfortunately, once I broke that bad boy open I was dismayed that what should've been a culinary treat was in fact plain, non-flavorful ice cream with hunks of rather hard pistachios in it. I was very disappointed with the experience and hope to never run across a similarly disappointing flavor again."
38_bj,DianaK,2019-03-13,5,The Very Best!,1,0,"This is our family’s favorite I’ve cream EVER! It has the perfect lightly nutty flavouring and a delicious, satisfying crunch of toasted pistachios throughout! Every bite is as good as the first! Sadly, I have not found this anywhere in my new home of Montreal, Quebec as the stores always only of the same few flavours (I’m guessing as branding for both French and English up here is costly). However, it surprises me that this is not one of the few options uphere as we have a huge European population (that, of course, loves pistachios). I would think it would be a huge hit! Sadly, B&J’s can’t ship time either? Sincerely, Heartbroken in Canada (a.k..a. Diana ;) )"

But when I finally tried it, it was not the same ice cream I was used to. The pistachios were soft and chewy and the ice cream did not taste like pistachio ice cream. I went to the same store again to buy another pint 2 days later and I was rewarded with the same bland tasting ice cream with soft pistachios. Plus once the ice cream melted a little, it was a little too frothy like there was extra milk or something in this particular batch. So very disappointed with Ben & Jerry's. I love this flavor, but not sure I want to risk a 3rd time."

It's pretty good when one or two nuts are a bit 'off'. But tonight I chewed into the most rancid, putrid pistachio of my entire life. Nearly hurled. Will not purchase again."
38_bj,Dawn0719,2018-03-29,5,Always Top Notch!,2,0,B&J's Pistachio Pistachio is my all-time favorite ice cream - ever!!! The creamy smooth flavored ice cream and the crunchy salty nuts always give me exactly what my taste buds are craving. I remember the first time I ever tried this - I thought I died and went to heaven! <3 True Perfection <3
38_bj,,2018-02-09,5,All time favorite ice cream!!,2,0,This is the ONLY ice cream I buy and I have tried all the pastachio flavors of different brands. I will drive the extra couple miles just to get this stuff. I don't see how anyone could rate this one star.
38_bj,Naboo,2018-03-25,5,"This is my favorite, my GO-TO for ice cream.",2,0,I have been eating Pistachio-Pistachio for several years and never grow tired of it. My favorite and before that is was New York Super Chunk. It takes a great deal to pull me away from good chocolate
38_bj,Kittykate88,2018-01-17,5,Yeasss,2,0,Anything less than 5 Stars don’t appreciate pistachios.. the guy who compliains that the nuts are too hard... Obviously is not a nut lover. This is a must if you enjoy crunch and nuts
38_bj,lbcgav,2017-06-17,1,Ok if you like almond extract,12,17,"Here's the irony: ""The name alone shows how much we love pistachios. But don't just take our word for it - let the flavor speak for itself!"" The most forward flavor is almond extract, not pistacchio. Too bad, because there's not much better than a good pistacchio gelato. This is nowhere near that."
38_bj,herbgreen,2018-08-10,5,A Private Joy,1,0,This ice cream falls into the category of private joy for me. The superb flavor and variety of texture between the silky ice cream and chewy pistachios elevate me to another plane. My ultimate indulgence is to sip a glass of scotch along with a bowl (I try to keep it small!) of this wonderful confection. An adult treat!
38_bj,Never Again,2020-04-27,1,Great if you like DISAPPOINTMENT,0,0,Horrible! Judging by the taste they have never had a proper pistachio dessert . You're better off spending extra money on another brand of pistachio. Or just getting a different flavor. This is my first time trying ben and Jerry's and I apparently picked the worst flavor of theirs imaginable. If I were to name this flavor it would be Pathetic pistachio. I'd give a constructive review but clearly they have been okay with the atrocity for this long and I dont believe it would help. 1 star for the fact that its icecream
38_bj,augieke,2018-08-08,5,Had several pints and loved them all so far,1,0,"I guess everyone can make a lemon, but I haven't encountered one yet in the Pistachio Pistachio flavor. Especially like the salted pistachio mixed with the vanilla. The pistachios were good and fresh in all the pints I've had. Always look for it on the shelf now. Keep up the good work!"
38_bj,mitzie,2018-07-30,1,HORRIBLE ICE CREAM,3,6,"I bought this yesterday from whole foods and all day thought, that a company like Ben and Jerry's would make the finest pistachio ice cream ever.
This ice cream is tasteless and seems to have been made for the sake of making it marketable. the ice cream does not even taste of vanilla ice cream. It tastes like ""paper ice cream"" if ever someone were to make paper a taste.
Such a waste of time and money. !"
38_bj,FuzzyGut,2018-07-07,5,Another great Flavor from Ben and Jerry’s,1,0,"I’m mean, here I am about to dig into another pint for the first time, and of course it’s excellent, just like the majority of the other ones. The ice cream itself is delicious; creamy and pistachioey and the pistachios are perfect. Killer pint! Thanks again guys!"
38_bj,purdybirdy,2017-09-29,2,Has potential but not as good as I'd hoped,2,2,"I appreciate the use of real pistachios in the ice cream because you don't see that too often. But because the pistachios are whole aaand there's so many in there, it's just a little too much. Maybe if they were smaller pieces and a tad bit less frequent. The ice cream flavor is nice though. Not too strong and artificial tasting like some pistachio ice creams are."
38_bj,Fish,2017-06-09,5,Something went wrong,1,0,"My favorite!! I would never give less than five stars for Ben and Jerry's, however I think the last batch of this amazing ice cream was light on the pistachio... Usually full of them this one only had maybe ten total!! Still the best around."
38_bj,KJoPistachio,2018-06-17,5,Pure happiness,1,0,I didn’t have really high expectations when I bought this today but after tasting it just now I am headed back to the store to buy all of the containers. I’m pretty sure that if everyone ate some of this then there would be peace on earth!
38_bj,Kyle,2018-03-27,5,Frozen Gold!,1,1,"I’m a picky eater. Especially when it comes to nuts. Often you’ll buy a batch of pistachios, and a handful will be sour or off. When I buy Pistachio Pistachio, I never get a nut that is off. I’ve purchased this flavor COUNTLESS times. It is my favorite Ice Cream. I have never had a Pistachio that is less than amazing in these magical pints. I swear by this flavor. Do yourself a favor and enjoy this heavenly treat!"
38_bj,yfu002,2019-07-14,2,no pistachio taste,4,5,"The pistachio chunk is real, but the ice cream itself does not have any pistachio flavor. Put together it is a blank ice cream with pistachio chunks. I can buy a pint of regular vanilla flavored ice cream and eat with some pistachio on the side instead of this."

38_bj,Berkley,2019-02-07,5,Addicting!,1,0,I always stick to the same kind of ice cream but recently I decided to try something new and now I'm addicted. I buy a pint of Pistachio Pistachio at least twice a week if not more and I don't care :)
38_bj,winterdestiny,2017-06-17,5,Favorite Flavor,1,0,"This is my favorite flavor ever! Ever since I tried this flavor, I rarely pick another. It has a great sweet flavor to balace it out with the roasted pistachios. It's indulgent without being too rich."
38_bj,,2018-06-01,5,Simply the Best Pistachio Ice cream!,1,0,I usually buy pistachio gelato at the local ice cream store but I was in Publix at the time. This pistachio is by far the BEST I have ever had! You will not be disappointed!
38_bj,Peacelover9,2020-01-11,5,This is one of my favorite flavors.,1,0,I always use to buy Karmel Sutra. But I thought I try this one. Its great!!!
38_bj,Jules,2018-04-05,1,Bland flavor,2,3,"I was excited to try this flavor since it was gluten free (one of the few B&J options I can have) and Ben & Jerry's is my favorite ice cream-with quality ingredients and great flavors. But, was disappointed-felt like the pistachio flavor was weak and the base almost icy in texture."
38_bj,Mamma Kate,2018-09-04,2,Not Pistachio Ice Cream,1,1,"This flavor should be named “Almond Extract Ice Cream with Pistachios”. I was disappointed by the flavor profile. There is a generous quantity of pistachio nuts throughout the pint, but their flavor is overwhelmed by the almond extract, which by the way, has a bitter and lingering finish. Good consistency and mouth feel."
38_bj,Lars,2018-07-31,5,What Happened?,1,5,"Used to be heavenly. When I could find it, it was the best of the best. Six on a five star scale. It was pistachio through and through. Generous portion of pistachios nuts embedded in a delicious body of pistachio flavored ice cream. Then somebody in the last year went and spoiled the recipe with coconut oil. Now it's pistachios in coconut ice cream. Who messed with perfection?"
38_bj,Bloomable,2020-06-07,5,Best Pistachio Ice Cream,0,0,"This is my favorite pistachio ice cream. The ice cream tastes simply like real pistachio with the roasted pistachios being the perfect added texture. I have purchased many pistachio ice creams from other brands and when Ben and Jerry’s came out with this one I have never looked back. Other favorites for me are Netflixed and Chilled, Cherry Garcia, and the discontinued Creme Brûlée."
38_bj,ccoco,2019-02-18,2,All I taste is almond extract,1,1,"I honestly dont know what I was expecting with this being my first taste of any pistachio ice cream, but all I could taste was almond extract. Even the smell of the icec ream smells like almonds?"
38_bj,Kim94,2019-04-14,1,Love pistachio but too much,0,2,"I love pistachios so I thought I would love this ice cream. Unfortunately the pistachios overwhelm the ice cream so it’s too savory for me. I thought way to many nuts, maybe if they were halved or crushed, the flavor would go into the cream. Very disappointed and won’t get again. The amount of nuts (I know, you’re supposed to get at least one nut per spoonful, but way to much."
38_bj,Geouhread,2017-07-05,1,Overpowering Almond taste,2,5,"The icecream itself had a very strong bitter almond flavor taste, the texture of the cream also was very gritty. We expected the product was expired but it wasn't."
38_bj,Kjlee85,2020-05-05,1,almond almond pistachio,0,0,"I'm ok with almond but it disappointed my wife who is a pistachio lover but an almond hater. This tasted more like almond ice cream with pistachio nuts. Compared to pistachio ice creams we have had, this falls far short for any nutty, strong pistachio lingering fragrance and taste we were expecting from a name like ""pistachio pistachio"""
38_bj,,2017-12-20,5,Best ice cream EVER.,0,1,"This ice cream by far beats any other brands. The ice cream has a perfect creamy taste, with whole pistachios. It's just hard to find because the stores by my house are always sold out of this flavor. But any time I do buy ice cream I will drive the distance just to get this."
38_bj,japanese girl,2018-04-13,1,Umm...,1,4,"I bought pistachio ice cream because I like pistachio flavor. But this vanilla's flavor is like Dr. Pepper. So, weird. I expected it taste really pistachio."

38_bj,Scootl,2020-02-06,1,Vanilla ice cream with large chunks of pistachio,0,0,"Basically vanilla ice cream with large chunks of pistachios. The nuts are not broken up. I understand if you don't want to use artificial coloring, but the pistachios should be broken up into smaller pieces! That would make it tastier."
38_bj,Dallas16,2020-05-21,5,Beyond Delicious,0,0,"This is my favorite. So glad that the ice cream is also pistachio flavor, not just vanilla ice cream with pistachio nuts added. The nuts are whole and big, not just pieces and slightly salty. Worth the price. Love it !"
38_bj,,2018-11-29,3,"A great ice cream ruined by hard, salty pistachios",0,1,"I want the pistachios removed and this ice cream labeled ""Amaretti for More!""
Then I'd eat it and never stop. As it is, I spit out the pistachios and enjoy this almond extract flavored ice cream immensely."
38_bj,Pistacho,2017-08-24,5,Almondy pistachio,0,0,I like the flavors going on in here. The ice cream has a taste reminiscent of marzipan and pistachio mixed and there is a generous amount of crunchy pistachios. This was quite tasty and I'll buy it again.

I stumbled across Pumpkin Cheesecake at Albertsons in Wildomar, CA and this has to be the best Ben & Jerrys yet! My husband said he's ready to spend a ton of money to stock up. It's identical to actual pumpkin cheesecake! During the 110 degree temps it's sooooo good! I'll be raving about this! Thank you for bringing back another amazing cheesecake flavor!"
39_bj,Sandy,2017-09-10,5,In My Life!!!!!,4,0,"This has been my favorite ice cream since 2008 when I first tasted this flavor. Since then, finding it was the worst experience ever! It is made in limited batches, and was NEVER in the same store every year, so you became an explorer to find it each year! Was it in Walmart, Wegman's, Shop Rite, CVS, or where every September? I knew this was the time the first batch was delivered! FINALLY, this year they have a specific page on their website for Pumpkin Cheesecake. All you have to do is put in your zip code, and it will tell you where is the nearest establishment to purchase this in incredibly, tasty, scrumptiously delicious frozen treat!!! Good luck, and be careful of brain freeze! You're gonna love it!!!"

39_bj,bridgespo97,2019-10-31,1,COULD BE AMAZING IF....,5,4,"I bought this last weekend, I am not sure how but it was still available at a local Walmart. I have been wanting to try this flavor, and figured it was long gone, but to my surprise I was able to find it, so I figured it was a sign from above. Overall, the pumpkin flavor tastes familiar... But over seasoned... It is a bit boring, and honestly this ice cream could be amazing. The graham cracker swirl is more of a.... occasional chunk. Honestly, the graham cracker swirl was to die for!! It was the highlight of this ice cream... If they could just add more swirl, I would be much more impressed overall. The swirl definitely breaks up the boredum of the ice cream, it is a bit repetitive. I think a huge glob of swirl would be amazing."
39_bj,Miercoles,2020-09-01,5,BEST ICE CREAM EVER,1,0,I just bought this flavor from target.. i went there to get chunky monkey but they were all out.

My dad introduced me to pumpkin ice cream at Baskin Robins when I was a kid and although he passed away, every time I eat this B&J flavor, I think of him. Your pumpkin ice cream doesn’t have a weird after taste I’ve experienced in other pumpkin ice creams. (Which I only bought out of desperation when I couldn’t find B&J.) The graham cracker swirl is heavenly and like an extra blessing of happiness! I look forward to autumn every year so I can eat your Pumpkin ice cream and think of my dad."

I hadn’t seen this icecream in about 3 to 4 years in my local stores. I checked so hard for it every year when fall hit. I even checked stores when I was out of town, ect. I finally found it this year at the store it’s been missing from, and I’m so happy. It is just as amazing as I remember. Wish it wasn’t a limited batch! Hope to see it next year!"

39_bj,Icecreamfan4life,2018-12-05,2,Unexpectedly Good,0,0,"Just picked this up a couple of days ago. Figured since it was my year to try out some of these much beloved pumpkin spice and pumpkin flavored items, that come out. I would give this ice cream a try. I'll be the first to admit pumpkin flavored anything is not a go to favorite flavor for me during the Fall or otherwise. So I had low expectations going in. But once I tried out a little bit that was inside the lid....have to say I fell in love with this super light pumpkin flavor. Even enjoyed the light graham cracker swirl. Just the further down I went into the pint, not sure if it was do to the larger the swirl became or the mix of the graham cracker with the spice in the pumpkin in the base. But the taste of the swirl just got real nasty throughout the middle section of the pint. But it got better again towards the end though."

Naturally the one ice cream I love is limited batch. Anyway, it’s amazing. It tastes exactly like pumpkin cheesecake and the graham swirl is awesome. I could eat this all year. I would eat this all year if it was available."
39_bj,Laine,2018-12-03,5,PLEASE Make This a Full-Time Flavor,0,0,"This is my all time favorite flavor and I am already having trouble finding it in stores! Like said in the description, it's not pumpkin spice flavored so I do not feel like it would go out of taste at other points in the year. I am in love with the graham cracker crunch in it, and the ice cream is so incredibly creamy (probably from the real pumpkin). Please please please make it a full time flavor!"
39_bj,Gerry,2019-09-15,5,Great if you can find it!,0,0,"This is truly a flavor everyone should try. Unfortunately this can only be found in a few big box stores or super marts. The B&J locator shows what stores have it in stock. But when i get there, i find a messy freezer with flavors all over the place. When i ask the staff for help , they are clueless and defiantly not on target. I hope to find this ice cream some day but for now i will keep looking"

It’s like spooning into a fresh, creamy pumpkin cheesecake, the graham cracker swirls make it absolutely perfect! My only issue is trying to get my hands on a few pints, they sell out super fast, so if you see them? Grab ‘em! If you’re like me & love pumpkin EVERYTHING, you’ll absolutely love this ice cream. It’s worth stocking up on :)"

But to open it and it have zero flavor because i think it was not stored properly..it was all mushy and had crystals and wouldn’t harden.. ughh"
39_bj,,2018-10-22,3,The gram cracker,0,1,"This is actually my favorite ice cream but the last few years I noticed it's hardly any Graham cracker. You guys use to put a thick layer of crackers in the ice cream m that's what make it so good. What happened. Is it to save money. I almost don't wanna buy without the
thick Graham cracker. I feel the same about strawberry cheesecake also"
39_bj,Britms6133,2020-01-26,5,Just like actually pumpkin pie,0,0,"Perfect for those that enjoy pumpkin flavors. Amazing for the fall, but I could enjoy this year round. The ice cream was creamy, good balance of sweetness, with a good ratio of ice cream to graham cracker swirl. I wish there was more of a cheesecake flavor, maybe add some cheesecake bites. I would buy again."
39_bj,SarahSS,2017-10-09,5,This is a must-try for Fall!,0,0,"I'm usually not one for the trend of all pumpkin-flavored or pumpkin spice-flavored things, but I saw the Pumpkin Cheesecake B&J at the store and I had to try it. Oh my goodness, I'm so glad I did! The flavor is delicious and the graham really brings it to a 5/5. I've already purchased 3 pints!"

So when I saw this AND saw it was ben and jerrys I was in! However when I tried it it was kinda underwhelming in pumpkin taste. The cheesecake was there but the pumpkin taste was little to none. Maybe it was just a bad pint pick but I'm still super sad about it."

39_bj,KatB,2018-10-22,1,Not sure if I got a bad pint or not...,0,5,"I bought this a few months ago, and I think it might have been old, because the ice cream was incredibly frosted and I couldn't distinguish any sort of graham cracker swirl at all. Definitely disappointed."

40_bj,Nathalier12,2019-06-09,3,it has potential.,10,4,"i give this icecream a 3 star. because 5 js licking spoon to its core. 4 is not enough chunks but yummy creamy icecream flavor. 3 is.... well this. def not enough cookie or strawberry. and not enough blueberry icecream flavor. needs LOTS more. tasted like vanilla icream with very rare moments of tastebud excitement when the tiny chunks of shortbread were finally dug up. Did i eat it in 2 days? yes. Did i enjoy eating it? yes. Did i look forward to wating it in the future? no i forgot about it which means it wasnt great. Will i buy again? if they advertise it after this review "" with an overload of added chunks"".... ps.. looks nothing like the picture smh :("
40_bj,metalpasta,2019-06-21,3,Where's the raspberries?,4,1,"I read the description of this flavor and thought this might be an instant classic. Raspberry and blueberry ice cream? And strawberries too? Ooh! But I have to say this flavor was a disappointment. All I could taste was vanilla and the shortbread. Now blueberry isn't the strongest flavor in the world, but you would think it could be amped up at least a little. And maybe it's just me but I could not taste the raspberry at all. And the pint I purchased had only a few bites of strawberry. The flavor was not bad, but it was nothing like i was expecting. Instead of ""wow!"", all I experienced was ""meh"". I'll stick with my old favorites and keep hoping for a resurrection of ""That's My Jam""."
40_bj,Icecreamfan4life,2019-05-09,5,Totally unexpected willy wonka experience!,8,2,"Okay as I said in another review. I bought this with 2 other flavors(Sammie flavor and the sweet like sugar flavor), and I was the most leery of this flavor. As I tend to enjoy fresh blue and raspberries as opposed to having them in ice creams. As they just don't taste right or good to me. But in this flavor. I'm not sure if it was the fact that there was the vanilla swirl and short bread cookies, that balanced things out or what. But this turned out to be a lot better than I expected. Again, I know others may not like it, because it's not one of B&J's chunck induced, fudge freckled classics. But it's definitely a step in the right direction in balancing out more natural even flavors, with deep, rich, and sometimes too salty flavors as well. So definitely keep mixing it up for sure."
40_bj,Dandani8,2019-10-10,5,AhhhhhMazing,0,0,"I love this flavor !!! The bursting flavor blueberry and raspberry and little fireworks of strawberries and shortbread pieces is a delicious way to make any day better, but not only that but every bite is so satisfying and gets better bite after bite!!! Definitely my new favorite!"
40_bj,mer13,2019-06-25,2,Lacking flavour,2,1,"The vanilla itself isn't even that great tasting and vanilla is all this ice cream flavour really is. The blueberry and raspberry portion of ice cream taste just like the vanilla, the strawberry pieces are few and far between, and the short bread chunks were about the same. The ice cream could be a great flavour if they reworked it and added some more flavour to the blue ice cream portion and adding a little more chunks of fruit and cookies."
40_bj,Mmemimsmom,2019-12-06,1,Major Disappointment,2,12,"I was so excited to find this flavor (raspberries, blueberries, strawberries, shortcake! ! ) and so disappointed when I tasted it. First off, grayish purple ice cream is just NOT RIGHT! Second, flavor. It doesn't taste like anything but overly sweet vanilla. I found 3 threads of red that, if you squinted, might have been strawberry. The globs of shortcake were a disgusting greenish color and again, too sweet. No fruit flavors. Would I buy this again?? No. Will I finish the pint? No. Will I buy B&J's again? Meh."
40_bj,RaeRaeMae,2019-07-17,2,Not enough shortbread!,1,0,"If you tripled the amount of shortbread, at least, I could give this a 3 star rating. But it also hardly had any strawberry; maybe 5 tiny little pieces(but that's a stretch) Raspberry? Where? That was non existent. And the blueberry could also be kicked up a notch... Also, just take out the vanilla all together. Other than the name, there is no need for it."
40_bj,,2020-08-31,5,I Want a Painting of This on My Wall,0,0,"I bought this on vacation expecting nothing but then I ate it and the texture reminded me of Play-Doh in all its glory (without the smell, which is still awesome in its non-edible glory) and it was SO GOOD. This is the first time in over 10 years I sat down and almost ate the entire pint and it had nothing to do with any kind of appetite stimulating...um...recreational activities. YUM is the three letter word that a Jeopardy question would ask and this would be the answer. More of this all day, at all times."
40_bj,MirandaR,2019-06-26,5,My favorite,1,0,I have bought 3 of these! So delicious. Sometimes I find the flavors overwhelming so this is a great one for people like me who enjoy ice cream but not crazy amounts of different flavor.
40_bj,Sky77,2019-08-01,2,"Mild, vanilla flavor",1,0,"If you ate this with your eyes closed, you would swear it’s vanilla with an occasional chunk of something that you couldn’t really place. Good vanilla, but...vanilla."
40_bj,Shmeezy,2019-05-20,3,Just ok,1,0,Wasn’t gross because it’s ice cream. :-p. However I was very disappointed. Tasted very plain like vanilla. Not a lot of chunks either. Not fruity at all.
40_bj,Zeus1995,2019-05-26,4,Good but could be better,1,0,"I enjoyed it but could be better. more shortbread chunks, more strawberries, and stronger blueberrie taste"

40_bj,Vnessa,2019-05-21,5,LOVED IT!,0,0,"Almost like eating a berry pie! I love this. I have been waiting around for this type of flavor/texture since another company launched a similar flavor YEARS AGO but with graham cracker crust! They only had it through summer and i haven't seen it since! I really enjoyed this because it wasn't chocolate, caramel, candy, etc. This is my FAVORITE! Please do not discontinue this flavor!"
40_bj,Goldie,2019-07-04,1,Disappointed!,1,1,I only had white and blue ice cream that lacked flavor. No strawberries or shortbread pieces. This definitely is not an ice cream I would purchase again.
40_bj,Briarhopper,2019-05-12,1,Just tastes like vanilla,1,1,Usually love Ben and Jerry’s but this was the most bland ice cream I’ve ever eaten from them
40_bj,Vivicart,2019-06-24,3,I wish it had more flavor,0,0,I picked this up with the new Ice cream Sammie flavor and I have to admit this flavor was underwhelming for me. I’d like to see more of the raspberry and cookies pieces inside. Unlike like the Ice cream Sammie flavor this one is flavorful enough for me. I wanted more but really loved the idea of the flavors all together.
40_bj,Hoop,2020-07-11,1,Mhh,0,0,"Tried this tonight and found it tasteless and boring. There were some little reddish dots of something, with some pale violet swirls that were tasteless. There were some gritty cake-like bits in the colored swirl. B&J make such great ice cream...this is not one of them.
I wish I had purchased some other flavor."
40_bj,Emilysmimi,2019-06-11,2,Big Disappointment,0,0,"I bought this flavor because I loved the Maine Blueberry ice cream that Ban and Jerry’s used to make. All I tasted was vanilla with what seemed to be something like pound cake globs. I even tried tasting the flavors separately but no berry flavor to be found. Also, MIA were the strawberries. So sad"
40_bj,pixellkitten,2020-02-10,2,Meh I wouldn't get it again,0,0,"Was super excited about this one, but all i taste is vanilla and even though my pint looks filled with blueberry, theres no flavor, no berries and no shortbread!

41_bj,jnewbio,2018-07-01,5,"Best flavor, but hard to find!",29,0,"This has long been my favorite Ben and Jerry's flavor - the chocolate ice cream in it is deep, dark and delicious, the graham crumb swirl adds just the right bit of texture, the ""toasted marshmallow"" is more complex than the straight-up marshmallow in Phish Food, and the chunks of chocolate are of the highest quality. Sadly it is hard to find in my area - I look for it in any store I go into and when I find it, buy as many cartons as can fit in my freezer! I tried the new Limited Edition ""Gimme S'More"" flavor and found it very disappointing. I certainly hope Ben and Jerry's isn't planning to replace the classic S'mores with this new flavor - I'd be heartbroken!"
41_bj,Elizcady,2018-06-10,5,All Time Favorite Flavor,16,0,"I could eat ice cream everyday and am a bit of a chocoholic, so naturally this is my go to flavor for Ben and Jerry's. Although there are several other chocolate based flavors, its hard to compare and I went through serious withdraw when I couldn't buy it when living in the U.K. While this used to be easy to find in my local grocery stores, I've recently seen it replaced with the new Gimme S'more flavor on the shelves. I am hoping that it isn't going to be discontinued, as the new flavor is completely different. Never one to write reviews, but I feel so passionately that I wanted it to be stated that some of us out there love this one, despite the lower rating."
41_bj,Cait5,2018-12-11,5,"All-time favorite, but so hard to find!",13,0,"This is my all-time FAVORITE ice cream flavor--period. Ben & Jerry's is terrific, but they have far outdone themselves with S'mores. Nothing else compares. It's been my favorite ice cream since I was a kid, and nothing has ever come close to replacing it. Unfortunately, it also happens to be the MOST DIFFICULT flavor to find. There are no retailers near me that still carry it--it seems to have been phased out, and I hope not in favor of ""Gimme S'more,"" which can't hold a candle to the original S'mores. The rich chocolate flavor, punctuated by fudgy chocolate chunks; paired with velvety toasted marshmallow and delightfully crunchy, textured graham cracker swirls--nothing compares!"
41_bj,Matthart82,2017-07-14,5,My favorite of all time,26,1,"This is by far my favorite ice cream ever. I don't know what it is, but I am totally addicted to it and will pretty much eat the entire pint in one sitting, even though I don't like eating ice cream that much. I've driven long distances to buy this and was on the website right now just to find out where I can buy this since I just moved to a new state. I was shocked to see that this has some negative reviews and I felt that I should pay the ice cream back by writing this review. But anyway, best ice cream ever."
41_bj,Livy,2017-08-02,1,In serious need of an overhaul,33,32,"The main problem with this flavor is that it has a very poor balance between the three components of a s'more: graham cracker, chocolate and marshmallow. In its current iteration, the chocolate ice cream base completely overpowers everything else to the point where you're left with what tastes like plain chocolate ice cream.
I would suggest completely reinventing this flavor with a graham cracker flavored ice cream base, with chocolate chunks and a much more generous amount of marshmallow swirl.
I think this flavor has the potential to be a fantastic, stand-out flavor, but as it stands I will not be buying it again."
41_bj,Phish Food Fan,2018-11-02,5,The Melter,5,0,"I love Ben and Jerry’s. There are a few flavors in particular that I call Melters. This is because I melt into euphoria at the first bite. There are a few that are so good that with the first spoonful I am in heaven. This S’mores ice cream is perfect in my opinion. The chocolate base (B&J does chocolate better than anyone) is dense, rich, sweet, and decedent. The graham and toasted marshmallow play perfectly together and create layers that come apart while spooning, and with the fudge chunks, and this effect makes the pint ridiculously delicious! Just FYI, the other melters are Chocolate Fudge Brownie, Phish Food, Chocolate Therapy, Half Baked, Gimme Smore, Tonight Dough, Peanut Butter World and Chubby Hubby."
41_bj,SarahSS,2017-07-01,5,Favorite!,16,0,"S'mores is by far my favorite B&J's flavor. I was upset to see the other reviews saying they were so disappointed! Maybe it was something in a recent batch or whatever, but anytime I get it, it's always perfect! The graham cracker swirls are the best part. So delicious!"
41_bj,DeeDee_BakedZiti,2017-05-04,5,The best of the best,14,1,"I'm in love with S'mores. In fact, I fell in love with my husband over a pint of S'mores. As teenagers, we shared spoonfuls of the richest chocolate, creamiest marshmallows and bites of graham cracker perfection. 15 years later, we still go ""gaga"" when we spot it in a store. My only wish is that we could find it more often--it's certainly hard to come by in the tristate area."
41_bj,l0lu47smores,2018-12-06,5,My Very favorite and that's saying something,4,0,Ever since I was a baby I have loved this flavor. When we did a vote in our family about who was the messiest ice cream eater I was voted number one but especially with this flavor. I find this flavor my very favorite and I think that no other flavor is even close in the good range. You're in heaven when you eat it. It has the perfect amount of every flavor. I love it! Definitely a must in your freezer!
41_bj,SugaHG,2017-09-15,1,For Chocolate Lovers Only...Unfortunately,3,8,"This flavor was a disappointment. The chocolate ice cream with chocolate chunks over powers the marshmallow swirl and the graham cracker has yet to be tasted. This flavor needs a revision. In the summer when you bite into a s'more you are instantly hit with the graham cracker taste that is followed by the marshmallow and then warm chocolate. This ice cream should be the same. Graham cracker flavored ice cream with an ample amount of marshmallow swirl followed by chocolate chunks and graham cracker bits would do this flavor justice. As it is now, I will never buy again, I won't even finish this pint!"
41_bj,Michele,2018-12-11,5,If anything happens to this flavor I will die...,5,0,There aren’t enough stores that carry this flavor! There aren’t nearly enough chocolate based b&j flavors but this one is perfect! The roasted marshmallow is so good & the graham is delicious. The only thing I might recommend would be to add more graham ... and to get more stores to carry it!
41_bj,mooksT,2020-06-08,5,Awesome flavor! Impossible to find.,0,0,"This is my wife's all time favorite flavor of B&J (going back to when it was called Marsha Marsha Marshmallow), but we cannot find it anywhere near us even though the Flavor Finder says 2 different chains in our area carry it. I've been to all of those stores in ~10 mile radius and they don't even have a slot for it on the shelf. B&J's online store doesn't even carry it. I would be willing to pay a hefty premium to have it delivered at this point. I did see it recently at a Safeway in California when I was there on business, but was not in a position to try and haul it home with me on a plane. WE WANT THE S'MORES!"
41_bj,JenR,2017-06-27,5,FAVORITE,4,0,My absolute favorite flavor of Ben & Jerry's! The chocolate ice cream as always is delicious. S'mores ice cream should always have a chocolate base. I love the texture of the chunks of chocolate and graham crackers. I'm glad they chose to go with a whipped marshmallow rather than fluffy marshmallow chunks. This flavor really can't be beat!
41_bj,Smores4lyfe,2017-05-30,5,The literal best flavor,5,0,"It's not like I can find it anywhere anymore but, it's still my favorite. Hopefully B&J will get with the program and have it more widely available in NYC again!"
41_bj,Sarah4,2017-05-14,1,Plain chocolate ice cream,21,10,Cannot even taste the graham cracker or marshmallow. I taste more marshmallow in the Phish Food. Chocolate should not be the base of this ice cream it completely overpowers anything else that could be there. I'd recommend a graham cracker ice cream with ample swirls of marshmallow and fudge as a remake of this flavor
41_bj,Zoid,2018-05-05,5,I officially have a new favorite flavor...,2,0,"Phish Food used to be my favorite, until I first had S'mores. Now I can't get enough of it. For some reason it only appears to be sold in Publix in my area, so I have to make the extra trek to Publix just to get me some S'mores. The problem is they sell out of it frequently so I have to check back often. Very well balanced and frankly addictive. Please expand the retail distribution so all the s'mores fans in my area don't have to fight for the limited inventory at Publix. THANKS!"

41_bj,Christy,2017-08-28,5,Best flavor on earth!,4,0,This is my addiction! I love it's more a semi sweet chocolate with the marshmallow and graham cracker... I have no idea what I will do if they ever stop making this ice cream. I call dibs on the recipe if you ever discontinue!
41_bj,trashpanda1971,2019-01-26,5,Legit the BEST,3,0,"I die of sadness every time I’m in the mood for B&J, but the store doesn’t carry this flavor...it has ALL THE THINGS...delish chocolate ice cream, graham cracker crack bits, and sweet, sweet toasted marshmallow swirls. One of the few foods in life that is worth the calories...when I see people give this flavor a low score I literally want to fist fight them."
41_bj,RS30,2018-05-20,5,Best ice cream ever!!!,2,0,"So this was my favorite ice cream ever!!! all the flavors match so well and the combination of the chocolate ice cream with the graham cracker is great. If I could ask for anything would be to have a little more graham cracker in it, but is still absolutely delicious. However I'm deeply sad to see that this flavor is no longer available... just so disappointing and now I'm struggling to find another ice cream to substitute my favorite ever S'mores! :("

Here's the deal, imagine your a the S'mores flavored ice cream for a moment...then you looks at yourself and essentially you realize you've been created as a competition to Rocky Road ice creams and your own sibling Phish Food. Someone else offered an amazing idea of making this a graham cracker ice cream GAME CHANGER!, lets take it onestep further,..Making it a CORE then my freinds you've done it, A S'mores in a pint, the outside consists of a Graham Cracker Ice Cream and a Marshmallow & Fudge core. idk food for thought."
41_bj,allisonlovesicecream94,2020-04-05,5,My favorite flavor! But so hard to find :(,1,0,"When I was living in NYC, I found this flavor one time in my local bodega. Ever since then, it's been my favorite Ben & Jerry's flavor. I recently moved back to Michigan and cannot find it anywhere! The graham cracker swirls balance out the decadent chocolate flavors and the toasted marshmallow adds this gooey element that is perfectly complex and sweet. Luckily, when I visit my boyfriend who is stationed in North Dakota, his store carries it and I'm able to get my fix. I hope this flavor never gets discontinued!"
41_bj,FuzzyGut,2018-06-23,5,Really good stuff.,3,0,"I just melt when I dig into certain B&J flavors and this is one of them. Everything about S’mores is great, I just wish the marshmallow and graham swirls were thicker. This is a great pint and I will definitely be buying it again."
41_bj,Stacey,2017-07-06,5,Best Flavor Ever!!!!,3,0,My husband and I drive all the way across town to buy this ice cream at least twice a week! It is the BEST! I love that is is very chocolatey with a hint of marshmallow and graham cracker. It's perfection!
41_bj,bluethreads,2017-08-05,2,lacks s'mores flavor,1,4,"I was excited to see a few brands of ice cream offering s'mores flavor at my supermarket! S'mores is one of my favorites! I thought the flavor might be difficult to capture in an ice cream and decided my best bet was to go for Ben and Jerry's. It seems I made the wrong choice, as their ice cream tasted like chocolate chocolate chip. There were a few graham cracker swirls, but I couldn't detect any marshmallows. I don't know if the marshmallows were supposed to be flavored within the graham cracker swirl, but the taste never came together as anything but chocolate. The ice cream was a super delicious chocolate chocolate chip ice cream, but if you are expecting an ice cream resembling s'mores, I'd try another brand."
41_bj,bmhansen513,2018-03-14,5,S'mores Lover's Dream,3,0,"If you are like me and enjoy S'mores, you will not be disappointed with this pint. I have read some of the bad reviews and I think people have come across some imbalanced pints, but that it no way should take away from what this flavor is at its best. I have had imbalanced pints in every flavor and chalk it up to nuances in the manufacturing process. This one may be slightly more prone to imbalances, but the flavor is so good that I am more than willing to put up with a few ""misses"" from time to time."

It tastes like Smores because it has marshmallow and Graham cracker and chocolate. The new one tastes like vanilla ice cream with Oreo cookie pieces. Nothing Smores about it."

I was so excited to try this flavor that I bought two tubs of it at the store, only to be sorely disappointed. This doesn't even taste like s'mores, it's basically just chocolate ice cream. The chocolate ice cream base overpowers all the other flavors... such a disappointment."
41_bj,Sarah,2017-05-21,2,Disappointed,2,1,"I'm a long time Ben and jerries fan, and I've never been let down by any of the flavors, until this one. In the entire pint I only got one bite of marshmallow, which is not what I expected from and ice cream named smores. It would have been an excellent flavor if it had more marshmallow and graham crackers in it."
41_bj,pollosmoky,2019-10-04,5,My Favorite,0,0,"My favorite, but suddenly I can't find it! I am overcome with grief at this development. Other chocolate/marshmallow-y ice creams suffice, but it's the slightly salty graham-y flavor that really makes S'mores fabulous. Phish Food is much too sweet, and all those dang fish are in the way. Please tell me you're not retiring this flavor. If you must retire it, I demand Glampfire Trail Mix be put in regular rotation, bc if I can't have a graham cracker swirl, then a pretzel swirl will have to do."
41_bj,j12345,2019-06-04,5,Favorite flavor ever!!,0,0,"I don't understand all the bad reviews for this flavor. It is my all time favorite, and I think it's perfect. The marshmallow and graham swirls give it a nice soft texture, with the chocolate chips giving it just a bit of crunch. It is a little heavy on the chocolate flavor, but then again, so are real s'mores. Graham and marshmallow are subtle to begin with and come through great here. I haven't tried the newer flavor that has graham ice cream, but don't know how it could improve on this!"
41_bj,Debra,2018-09-15,5,LOVE the strong chocolate flavor and mix ins,1,0,"Oh my goodness this is my favorite ice cream ever. The chocolate ice cream base tastes dark, which is so rare and hard to find. I absolutely love it and can't get enough. Thank you! I hope you never change the recipe."
41_bj,foodie29,2018-12-13,5,Amazing Flavor!,1,0,"This ice cream combines everything I love about smores. The chocolate ice cream is a perfect choice for the base--creamy, rich, delicious. Ben and Jerry's has managed to create an amazing gooey marshmallow with a real toasted marshmallow flavor. I go crazy over that marshmallow swirl. I'm also crazy for the graham cracker bits--they add some amazing texture to the ice cream that I love, and have great flavor. Then, to top it all off, the crunchy chocolate bits. This is a great ice cream if you like texture in your ice cream, and I do. This is fun to eat, and totally delicious. This is an ice cream you have to stop after the first bite (and the 20th!) to say ""Wow, that's good.""
Side note--I tried ""Gimmie Smores"" and found it frankly dull. It tasted like generic cookies and cream ice cream. It wasn't rich and decadent and exciting like this. S'mores is a far superior ice cream. Also, the Campfire ice cream hits some similar notes but still isn't as good. I don't like nuts, and I appreciate having some amazing ice creams that don't rely on those for interest. This is the real winner."
41_bj,NSEGS,2020-03-03,5,Best flavor ever!!,1,0,This is the best combination of flavors! We love this ice cream so much and it is impossible to find. Really hoping it is not replaced with the new Gimme S’mores flavor which is not great.
41_bj,Tyra,2017-08-28,5,One Word. Amazing!,1,0,"I took one spoonful of this and fell in love. I could not stop eating until I reached the bottom. Hope this never goes away. Did not have any marshmallows, but I was too in love to care."
41_bj,Lexx,2017-06-27,1,Very disappointing :(,2,5,I LOVE Ben and Jerrys ice cream. I LOVE anything s'mores flavored so I thought this would be my new favorite B&J flavor but unfortunately I was disappointed. It really did not taste like s'mores at all and tasted pretty much like plain chocolate ice cream. I was really rooting for this one because I love s'mores but this did nothing for me :( it would be the perfect ice cream if it tasted like actual s'mores!
41_bj,Mickfrogger,2017-09-11,1,Very disappointed,2,6,"What makes me sad is ben and jerrys has the ability to make this a great ice cream, but they didn't. It tastes like chocolate chocolate chip ice cream. I actually thought I got a dud pint because i couldnt taste any graham. If they did a separate thick graham cracker swirl a la their pumpkin cheesecake ice cream and a thicker toasted marshmallow swirl it could be what it claims to be. Won't buy this flavor again."

I found this flavor a few months ago and haven't had another flavor of ice cream since. I am super sad I can't seem to find this one anymore since it seems to have been replaced with the ""more s'mores"" flavor (which is infinitely worse)"

The only problem is that it’s so inconsistent! Lately I’ve only gotten mostly chocolate ice cream, barely any marshmallow inside the pints (which is my favorite part).

The balance between the traditional s'mores flavors (graham cracker, chocolate, and marshmallow) in this pint is completely off. It ends up tasting like plain chocolate ice cream. Now Ben & Jerry's has come out with an additional s'mores flavor. But why? Just revamp this one! Probably the most disappointing pint of ice cream I've ever bought."

I always love trying all your different flavors and was pretty excited to try this! But I could not taste anything but chocolate, good chocolate ice cream nonetheless. I would consider tweaking this recipe I could visibly see all the marshmallow swirl which seemed abundant but the chocolate ice cream base is to strong to even taste the other flavors."
41_bj,goldcrab,2017-06-02,2,Something feels wrong,0,0,"Usually this is my favorite flavor, have been treating myself every few months to S'mores for years. The one I bought today though, I almost thought it was a different product. Could barely see any marshmallow, the chocolate was overpowering, and I got a feeling I was eating condensed milk or something at times instead of anything s'mores related. I hope this was just a bad batch and not a permanent change :\"

41_bj,Amy77,2019-05-18,5,Best Ice Cream Ever!!!!!!!,0,0,Omg! This is the BEST ice cream you’ll ever have. It’s hard do find. They don’t even have it at their own ice cream shop. Gimme s’more is nothing like it - I wouldn’t even buy that. “S’mores” is the best! I hope they keep making it. It’s smooth and not too sweet. The chocolate flavor is awesome combined with graham crackers and marshmallows!! I LOVE this ice cream!!!
41_bj,ColoradoKate,2018-05-05,5,More S'mores I Implore,0,0,Been buying this chocolaty delight since my daughter was a toddler.....and she's now a licensed driver. This decadent flavor is my before-bed ritual. Smooth rich deep chocolate flavor with delicious fudge chunks and swirls of lip-smacking goodness. None of your other flavors compare to this delight. S'mores will always have a place in my heart.....and freezer.

Being that I love Ben and Jerry’s as well as s’mores, I was really excited to try this. The base flavor was fine but I was not reminded of s’mores while eating this. I actually didn’t even finish the pint, which never happens."
41_bj,Voltages230,2019-12-03,1,Not the flavor you're expecting,0,1,"I would expect a S'mores flavored ice cream to taste like my favorite dessert ever, a S'more. What I ended up getting was an overpowered chocolate flavor with tiny hints of graham cracker and even more chocolate in the form of the fudge chunks. I'm pretty disappointed in this flavor as usually I love B&J ice cream. Definitely won't be purchasing this again."
41_bj,jennk83,2018-08-27,5,Best flavor,0,0,"This is my all-time favorite Ben & Jerry’s flavor. They changed it up a bit sometime in the last couple of years, but it’s still very delicious. It has become increasingly difficult to find since the introduction of “Gimme S’more” (which I do not enjoy half as much), so when I do manage to find it, I stock up. Perfect flavor combination, not to be missed."

I love the creamy marshmallow swirls and the sandy texture of graham cracker crumbs, plus chocolate chunks.

It's as if you took your s'more and crumbled it in chocolate ice cream!"

The dark chocolatey ice cream base is stellar, the gritty swirls of almost wet sand textured graham cracker is SO GOOD and the touches of toasted marshmalllow swirled throughout just top it off perfectly.

41_bj,JakeJr9,2018-07-01,5,SPECTACULAR SMORES,0,0,Hey stores in Delaware - if you want my grocery business you had better start stocking this flavor. My favorite used to be chocolate and peanut butter ice cream. But once I tried Smores I find myself driving around until I find a store that carries it. Do yourself a favor - if you have not tried this flavor - do so now.
41_bj,Penelopetm,2018-05-27,5,Most addictive flavor of all!,0,0,"I absolutely love everything about this flavor. The chocolate base is the best. B&J has very few flavors with chocolate base and no nuts.
My only problem is that NONE of the stores around me carry it anymore. They all carry the new S'mores flavor - which isn't chocolate ice cream. Sad ice cream-less summer for me."

We can’t find it anywhere in North Carolina anymore. None of the other flavors are even close to comparing. Very sad that we can’t get it. It’s not even available in the online store.
41_bj,Gustine,2018-03-19,2,Disappointed,0,1,I was excited to see my store finally selling the s’mores flavor so I obviously bought it. I started eating it today and it’s just chocolate ice cream with a little bit of graham cracker and almost no marshmallow. I won’t be buying this again but I will recommend my favorites: Cherry Garcia and The Tonight Dough
41_bj,Nicky91,2017-09-21,1,Disappointing,0,2,I feel like they really dropped the ball with this flavor. The marshmallow and Graham crackers are entirely overpowered by the chocolate ice cream and chunks of fudge. I had really high hopes for this one. I think it would be so much better with a Graham flavored ice cream or even a marshmallow one.

41_bj,Lauren14,2018-02-09,5,I LOVE S'MORES,0,0,This flavor is my favorite because of the graham cracker swirls; they are to die for. This is always my ice cream go to and I am so sad that s'mores isn't sold at most ben&jerrys retailers. I have such a hard time finding it these days that I usually am forced to settle for other flavors.

Such dark chocolate ice cream...i don't understand why it has fudge, as s'mores do not...the marshmallow is not enough to help the overpowering darkness of the ice cream, and the graham doesn't taste at all, just contributes a sandy texture. Hard pass."

It is perfectly balanced between the chocolatey icecream, the marshmallows and the best of all, the graham swirls which to me seem to have a bit of saltiness... altogether, it's just yum."
41_bj,Angela94nj,2018-01-16,2,Just chocolate ice cream,0,1,"It just tasted like chocolate ice cream. I got a couple chocolate chunks but no marshmallows or graham crackers. I would never have called it was s’mores. For the price I pay, I’d like a decent amount of toppinggs mixed in. Disappointed."
41_bj,AJ105,2018-05-20,5,By far the best!,0,0,"This is my favorite Ben and Jerry’s variety, no question. I don’t generally like chocolate base, but this is just perfection. Love the complements to the rich chocolate base. I could buy this every visit to the grocery store."
41_bj,Purple Lb,2018-03-31,5,One of my 2 favorite B & J flavors!,0,0,Been buying this flavor for years. My favorite part is getting a big glob of marshmallow. Been having a hard time finding it in the usual stores recently but maybe they were just waiting for the weather to warm up here in PA.
41_bj,Mace,2018-04-30,5,Delicious!!,0,0,"This is my favorite flavor of ice cream! It got me through many hard nights of studying in college, and now I’m a successful engineer. It was clearly the S’mores!!"
41_bj,moorejennie78,2018-05-03,5,So much better the new Gimme S'mores,0,1,"This is my all time FAVORITE flavor. I go to the shop in Glenview just to buy it. The new version does not remind me of S'mores at all. This one does! Don't stop making it, even if it's just in the shops!!! Please!"
41_bj,Rika,2020-01-16,4,Almost perfect,0,0,I love anything s’mores and this was so close to being perfect. I thought it just needed more marshmallow and graham cracker so it would taste more like s’mores and less like a straight up chocolate ice cream.
41_bj,bslpeace,2020-08-19,5,I am literally obsessed with this flavor,0,0,"I love this flavor so so so much. I, however, can not find it ANYWHERE. This is really upsetting for me because it definitely deserves to be a more mainstream flavor, so it can be more accessible. Love it."
41_bj,Frange,2019-01-22,5,All time Favorite,0,0,This is my #1 pick ! I have to have it every other night. The graham cracker crunch and the chocolate chunks with the marshmallow taste just like s’mores and gives you that PERFECT CRUNCH ! I LOVE IT

41_bj,KDH92,2018-06-20,1,S’mores minus everything,0,1,I was excited to try this and highly disappointed that it was basically all fudge. I’ve always wanted to try B&J but I think I’ll stick to Blue Bell

I can't express enough how happy I am to have something I know will always please me. KEEP THIS FLAVOR AVAILABLE!

42_bj,CatNamedIceCream,2019-08-06,5,The Ultimate B&J Flavor,0,0,"I have always enjoyed Ben & Jerry’s ice cream, but most of the time, they are a bit too sweet for my taste. The Salted Caramel Almond is perfect. It is sweet, obviously, but not overwhelming. I almost couldn't stop myself from eating the whole pint in one sitting. This flavor needs to be added to the regular rotation!"
42_bj,One For the Road,2019-08-25,2,Hmmmmm,0,0,Not sure what to make out of this flavor. The ingredients say almond slivers. What I got was more like crushed almonds or small almond pieces. They gave the ice cream a 'gritty' texture which was not pleasing to my tongue nor teeth. Not sure if I got a 'crazy' batch but doubt if I will try again.
42_bj,Lover of the SCA,2020-08-14,5,Where has this been all these years??,0,0,"I've been quite reluctant to try B&J ice cream, because it always appeared to have flavors that didn't quite appeal to me. Well...you got me, you finally got me! This Salted Caramel Almond...whew!! Awesomeness!!! Please don't take this away."
42_bj,aldahl,2020-06-15,5,Amazing!!,0,0,This is my absolute favorite flavor! Great combination. I would even be happy without the chocolate bits in there because the ice cream with almonds paired with the caramel is amazing on its own. PLEASE never get rid of this flavor!!!
42_bj,DES1980,2019-06-01,1,Disappointing!,0,0,I bought the salted caramel almond because I love salted caramel. The one I purchased really lacked caramel. It was more vanilla ice cream with slivered almonds and chocolate chunks. Did I just purchase a dud?
42_bj,Dimarie16,2018-04-20,5,Love everything about this flavor!,0,0,"This is the ONLY flavor I ever buy, and over the past 2 weeks NOWHERE has it anymore and I am sooo upset! I’m assuming it was discontinued since its an exclusive flavor?? Please keep it forever!!!!"
42_bj,PaladinJasmine,2019-04-01,5,My favorite so far!,0,0,"Perfect amount of everything. Not too much caramel, not too much chocolate. But best of all are the almonds. Just slivers but they make a big impact."

43_bj,janetec,2020-04-09,4,,0,0,I give it a 4 star only because I think they should put more strawberries . Flavor is very good but lacks the fact that is strawberry cheesecake and it is a bit pricey.
43_bj,brandymaria,2019-09-24,5,,0,0,"This ice cream is breath takingley good!! It taste just like a cheesecake with fresh strawberries in it. I'm so happy to have found this kind because I make a lot of homemade shakes for my family especially on the weekend and when I brought this home for the first time I fixed them some on a Friday night and I looked and it was gone on Saturday night. That's how much they liked it and still like it, I put it in the back part of the freezer and put something in front of it so it will last longer than a day. Lol! I would highly recommend this brand and flavor of icecream to everyone and I will definitely be buying more of it!"

43_bj,tom_s,2020-07-14,5,,0,0,Im a Huge Ben & Jerry's Ice Cream fan! Its been my favorite brand for as long as i can remember and Im lucky enough to be one of the few places with a B&J's ice cream shop. But this flavor in particular has been my go to for years. Very rarely do i switch it up( unless its a different cheesecake flavor) . they really hit the nail on the head with this one. I have yet to find another brand of cheesecake ice cream that even comes close to comparison with B&J's. Their ice creams are usually around 5-7 bucks for a pint depending on if you get it at a grocery store or a convenience store but its worth the money.
43_bj,Beth1981,2019-09-24,5,The Best Strawberry Cheesecake Ice cream!,7,0,"I have been absolutely in love with this stuff every since the first time I tried it about 7 years ago. I have tried other brands of strawberry cheesecake ice cream when the store was out of ben & jerry's brand, and Ben & Jerry's is far superior to those because most of them use a strawberry jelly-like swirl instead of actual chunks of strawberry like Ben & Jerry's."
43_bj,ChrisColby,2018-10-07,3,"Strawberry, not so cheesecake.",7,1,"I love the idea of a strawberry cheesecake ice cream, but only one of those components really shine here. The strawberry flavor greatly overpowers the cheesecake, resulting in what tastes like a sweeter strawberry ice cream than a true hybrid. The graham cracker crumbs are a stand out, but even then, there's not quite enough. A decent flavor."
43_bj,catjthis,2020-06-24,5,,0,0,"Oh my God this is a problem! This ice cream is sooo freaking good I wanna cry! I've walked past this flavor so many times thinking it would be blah. Well is not... it doesn't taste super intense like cheesecake, it a more creamy and sweet taste that's slightly different but way better. Almost like a strawberry milkshake. It has frozen dry strawberries in it and huge chunks of tasty Graham crackers. I literally can't get enough!"
43_bj,E172,2018-10-07,1,What happened to the cheesecake pieces?!,23,13,This used to be my favorite. I haven't had it in 5 years so when I saw that it had come back I didn't waste any time splurging on it. It tastes almost the same but feels really thick and weird. That's probably because the cheesecake pieces were replaced with cheesecake flavored ice cream. I'm so disappointed.
43_bj,Mmbates,2017-09-09,5,Absolutely LOVE it,3,0,"I'm a huge Ben & Jerrys fan, half baked was always my go to flavor since I'm a chocolate fan. However, my boyfriend started getting strawberry cheesecake and after one bite, I'll never get any other flavor again. It's delicious, the graham crackers complete it. Would definitely recommend trying it! So refreshing."
43_bj,Tim1,2019-01-09,4,Delicious flavor,4,0,"I agree, very yummy, but need to double the amount of Graham cracker in it! Would be 5 stars if that happened!"
43_bj,Rachie,2018-06-15,5,Totally tastes like cheesecake! Love this flavor,2,0,"I am a huge cheesecake fan, so obviously had to try this flavor. And I gotta say, I was definitely not disappointed. The base tastes so much like cheesecake..there's the perfect amount of strawberries throughout..and the graham swirl is just enough to be like a crust. Everything about this flavor is perfect. I'm one who almost always adds some type of syrup for a topping, but this one doesn't need anything!"
43_bj,DeniseJack87,2018-06-09,4,Yummy,3,0,This is my favorite but I would love it even more if there was more crust in the ice cream. Sometimes I may get a pint and there is really no crust at all in it...
43_bj,jmarsenault1982,2020-07-26,5,,0,0,"I'm in love with the crust part like little crumbles with strawberries and a vanilla ish ice cream, so it's like heaven in your mouth. I wish there was a little more of the crumble part in the ice cream cause it's not proportioned right. Keep killin it. Hope this helps"
43_bj,LBeez,2018-06-30,5,The best!,2,0,"I usually go for Chocolate Fudge Brownie or Half Baked because I'm a chocolate freak.

43_bj,Mandelay,2018-10-07,3,Could be better,4,1,"This is good, but the graham cracker isn't very thick and it no longer has the cheesecake pieces. When eating it, it feels like it's missing something."
43_bj,Whyamihere,2018-10-07,3,Use to be my favorite,4,1,This use to be my favorite. Lately it seems like they have no graham cracker though. Disappointing....

43_bj,Eyajc,2018-03-15,5,Freaking delicious,1,0,I bought this yesterday and managed to finish the wholle pint. This is by far one of my favorite Ben And Jerry's Ice cream flavors so far. If I could change anything I would add more strawberries.
43_bj,Danni M,2017-08-22,5,Strawberry and Graham cracker bliss!!!,1,0,"I've been eating this for years and each time I eat this ice cream I fall in love all over again. Strawberry Cheesecake Ice cream is the very best. My favorite, I love this Ice Cream!!!!!!!"
43_bj,Carla,2019-02-07,2,Strawberry?,2,2,I was really excited to try this flavor because I've never met a Ben and Jerry's product I haven't loved. Unfortunately there is a first time for everything. The graham cracker and cheesecake flavors are so over powering you get no strawberry flavor. The result is so sickly sweet. There is no balance. Really bummed out!
43_bj,Boowhoo,2020-04-28,2,My fav but,1,0,I bought this at target and at first I was overjoyed with how tasty it was but then I realized that my ice cream was half empty literally the bottom half was air
43_bj,buzz,2019-03-20,4,"Not Enough GRAHAM CRACKER SWIRL, Please ADD MORE!",2,1,The flavor and premium quality ingredients are definitely superb except for the strawberries. They suck! Horrible texture! They gotta go! I spit them out when I eat this flavor.
43_bj,Breezymiss,2017-10-03,5,My new fave,1,0,"I'm usually go with Half-baked or American Dream Cone, but this one wins. The graham cracker swirl is it brings it all together."
43_bj,Nanalove,2017-12-24,5,Sooo Good,1,0,I love everthjng about this ice cream I actually wish it had more graham cracker swirl in it it’s so perfect highly addictive
43_bj,Vsalas2,2018-02-15,5,Delicious,1,0,Cheesecake flavor isn’t very strong but the strawberry and crust crumble is delicious
43_bj,CaptainKitten,2017-12-10,5,My favorite!,1,0,My #1 go too! I'd eat it all in one sitting but then I'd be sad when it's gone. ;)
43_bj,FuzzyGut,2018-10-29,5,Great ice cream,0,0,"This is a great flavor! The ice cream base is rich and sweet without being over the top, and the flavor is natural, not cheap and artificial like some other brands going after the same cheesecake profile. The strawberry mix-Ins are very yummy. It really hits the spot when you’re looking for strawberry cheesecake without wanting to eat actual cheesecake, unless you have a few scoops next to a slice of cheesecake... that sounds good so I’ll be back a little later :)"
43_bj,Mack,2018-04-28,5,Love It!,1,0,Favorite Ice Cream of theirs. Tastes vary good. Try it.
43_bj,,2018-02-06,5,Amazing,1,0,Its so delcious and super amazing and sooooo gooddd
43_bj,Danyel,2018-05-16,5,My FAVORITE,1,0,By far my favorite Ben & Jerry’s. Truly delicious.
43_bj,Dapper Dan,2018-10-05,1,Where's the strawberry?,2,4,"Ate about a quarter of this. So far i got the cheesecake and grahams. Still no strawberry, kinda missing the main ingredient."
43_bj,ashrod26,2018-10-07,2,Disappointing,1,1,I love love love cheesecake flavored ice cream but this strawberry cheesecake did not live up to my standards at all. I was disappointed in this flavor as I love Ben and Jerry’s ice cream!
43_bj,DianaLeigh128,2019-04-25,1,Where's the Cheesecake?,1,1,This would be my favorite flavor if it actually had cheesecake bits or cheesecake flavor ice cream... all you get are strawberries and graham crackers. Not my idea of cheesecake at all.
43_bj,Rebel of Mars 81,2019-07-17,5,Great Cheesecake Flavor,1,1,"The very first flavor of Ben & Jerry's, will always be a favorite. I think a lightly sweeten strawberry puree swirled in would be great compared to the strawberry chunks."
43_bj,zoey,2018-08-21,5,life changing,0,0,"this is my new favorite ice cream. tbh it doesn’t have an extreme cheesecake flavor, but the strawberry and the graham cracker swirl is to die for. the graham cracker tasted like a real pie crust. the ice cream does taste a little bit like cheesecake but it’s not overpowering. everything about it is delicious.only suggestion would be to add more strawberries."
43_bj,PhoenixRises,2019-09-01,5,Another old favorite!,0,0,"This one is another old favorite from B&J. I just wrote about how I first fell in love with B&J because of chocolate fudge brownie, so this is probably the second flavor I fell in love with. I also forgot how good this was until I got it on a Royal Caribbean cruise a few years ago and I started getting it again. It's a flavor that I will always come back to."
43_bj,tickldkfiifo,2017-09-26,5,Delicious,1,1,This is exactly how I remember it! Cheesecake and graham crackers bring this to life.
43_bj,strawberrycheesybabe97,2020-03-28,5,If this gets discontinued I'll probably die,0,0,"If grass is green and the earth is round, then this is Ben and Jerry's...nay...the world of dessert's best flavor of all time. OF. ALL. TIME. The truth is, no one else makes anything like this - the strawberry is juicy and the graham cracker bits are buttery. If heaven were a place on earth, it would be found at the bottom of this pint."
43_bj,natassjag,2020-04-07,5,,0,0,This is the best ice-cream ever!!! Strawberry Cheesecake is my favorite flavor and not too many brands make this flavor or does it taste this great. But Ben & Jerrys has the best tasting Strawberry Cheesecake flavor ice-cream ever with really cheesecake chunks in it. I highly recommend this flavor and brand because its the best!!!
43_bj,taylormarriiee,2019-10-22,5,,0,0,"The only ice cream I really like is Ben & Jerrys, their ice cream is just the best to me. This flavor which I dont even know if they make anymore as its not sold by me anymore and the chocolate chip cookie dough are my favorite. This one definitely tastes like a strawberry cheesecake in ice cream its so so good and I miss it"
43_bj,indiac4f44,2020-05-08,5,,0,0,This remains one of my all time favorites. The texture of this ice cream is amazing and Ben and Jerry's gets it right with the mixture of flavors. The sweet cream of the cheesecake ice cream. The cool strawberries combined with the saltiness of the graham cracker crust is an amazing flavor profile and the perfect spoonful.
43_bj,jaida_johns,2019-08-12,5,,0,0,"Probably my favorite ice cream flavor to date. It's hard to resist eating the entire tub when it's so delicious. I love the bits of strawberry and cheesecake in this; in particular, the cheesecake is so freaking delicious. The ice cream itself is sweet and creamy and is really good overall. Would absolutely buy again."
43_bj,whittybitty247,2020-05-28,4,,0,0,"I really like Strawberry Cheesecake in any ice cream but this was delicious if you enjoy real tasting strawberries. I get this product regularly because of it's simple small size, but I prefer others over this as I don't care for seeds so often. Sometimes I feel like there is no cheesecake which is also disappointing."
43_bj,MandyLou,2019-04-07,5,THE BEST OF THE BEST,0,0,This is my all-time favorite flavor from B&J! It has the perfect taste and balance of flavors. The only thing that I could say would improve this flavor is more of the graham cracker swirl as that is the best part and I am a “tunnel-digger” when it comes to eating this ice cream! Following the graham cracker swirl!
43_bj,Tricia,2020-06-04,1,Very disappointing!!! No strawberries!!!,0,0,What happened to the pieces of cheesecake? Will never purchase this again - big mistake. It appears we just overpaid for graham cracker crust cheesecake “flavored” ice cream. :( NOTHING like the pics on the container. Not something we EVER expected from Ben and Jerry‘s - shame in you - you can do SO MUCH better. :(
43_bj,Hananhf,2020-07-21,5,Love it!,0,0,"Ben and Jerry’s is more on the expensive side. So I either wait till it goes on sale or unless I REALLY want it. When I buy this flavor, the pint is ONLY for me. I live that there’s real cheesecake in there. As I’m writing this review, I can taste the ice cream. One of my favorite Strawberry cheesecake ice creams,"
43_bj,Lexa,2020-04-09,1,What happened to the Cheesecake Pieces!???,0,0,Strawberry cheesecake used to be one of my favorites.... but what happened to those gooey yummy sweet chunky pieces of the cheesecake!? Digging the graham cracker swirl but really miss the cheesecake pieces. It complimented the ice cream so well. Still got love for you B&J. New favorite.... Netflix and Chilled.
43_bj,morganh7c3a,2020-02-04,5,,0,0,"O.M.G. I didn't think I would like this as much as I do, but it's so good!!! Has the right amount of strawberry pieces, cheesecake ice cream, and Graham cracker swirls, which are my favorite!!! Honestly, my favorite cheesecake ice cream. I would definitely recommend if looking for something different. So good!!"
43_bj,jammin0127,2020-07-30,5,,0,0,"This is my all time FAVORITE ice cream. It's so rich and smooth. The graham cracker swirl add the right amount of texture to the ice cream and the strawberry chunks are a nice treat. When I was pregnant, I literally ate this ice cream for breakfast. It's just the right amount of sweetness to curb the craving."
43_bj,alexjftz,2019-12-25,5,,0,0,"This is one of my favorite ice cream flavors - great graham cracker swirl throughout plus strawberry and cheesecake pieces. It is sweet and creamy, but feels like such a treat. I have to pace myself and try to make a pint last a few times. I actually got to try this FRESH at the factory in Vermont"
43_bj,widowvenus,2020-05-21,5,,0,0,Frozen heaven in a tiny little tub. Every one has their very own favorite Ben and Jerry's Ice cream flavor and this one happens to be mine. That being said. No I don't like sharing. It's a little bit pricey depending on where you buy it but when something taste's this good who cares what it cost.

It is truly my favorite ice cream, I am constantly repurchasing this flavor. Its not too sweet and the cheesecake bits are heavenly. Absolutely obsessed."
43_bj,aleonard0228,2020-07-27,5,,0,0,Ben & Jerry's Strawberry cheesecake is delicious. It's the right amount of sweet and the graham cracker crust mixed in is my favorite part of this ice cream. It is a bit high priced so I usually only buy it once in awhile but it is definitely worth the money if you like strawberry cheesecake.
43_bj,memberefe9a,2020-06-17,5,,0,0,I was recommended this ice cream many times and I finally got the chance to try it. It is sooo good. It has a nice strawberry flavor and the crust that is in it is so delicious. The crust tastes like real crust that is on a strawberry cheesecake. This is now one of my favorite ice creams.
43_bj,aymar1,2020-05-12,4,,0,0,"This flavor was my go to flavor to treat myself after exams. I love how they have mini cups since some brands don't have single serve cups. These can be affordable, but look out for sales. Overall satisfied with the flavors they carry. If you haven't had Ben & Jerry's yet, go try some!"
43_bj,brymeshaf,2020-05-03,5,,0,0,I literally went to the 711 store and bought this ice cream for 2 weeks straight while in college lol. It is so amazing!!

I'm a little sensitive to dairy, so I try to avoid it, but I would gladly endure a night of stomach pain for this ice cream. The day Ben & Jerry's makes a non-dairy version of this will be the best day of my life."

43_bj,,2020-06-13,5,,0,0,"This is by far my favorite icecream EVER. And I've eaten allot of icecream. I've tried other brands of ""strawberry cheesecake"" and none even came close. It is well worth the few dollars extra. Ben and Jerry's absolutely know how to please their customers taste buds."

43_bj,lyoung0110,2020-03-06,4,,0,0,"Ben & Jerry's straw berry cheese cake ice cream is a strong, solid offering from them. Slight hint of cheesecake and a moderate amount of strawberry. The cheese cake bits in the ice cream make it great. Would be better with more graham crackers throughout."
43_bj,operadivainthemaking,2020-07-04,5,,0,0,"This is just ADDICTIVE! If you have an incredible sweet tooth like me, you'll love this.

43_bj,amgoddess_,2019-05-04,5,,0,0,Our favorite brand of ice cream or frozen yogurt. It can be kind of pricy but you get what you pay for. Always a lot of options as far as flavor goes; which is always a plus. We buy this a few times a month and its what we want for birthdays as well
43_bj,martinisweets,2020-04-22,5,,0,0,The only kind of Ben & Jerrys I buy. I love the way the graham crackers mix with the strawberrys and the sweet ice cream. If youre into strawberry cheesecake it doesnt really taste like one but it has a really good flavor for an ice cream version

43_bj,nayelid11,2020-07-04,5,,0,0,Ive tried several Ben & Jerrys flavors and this one is by far my favorite. The crunchiness of the cheesecake with the strawberry flavor is just perfect. This ice cream isnt as sweet as all the others which is probably the best part.
43_bj,nicolec7247,2019-12-08,5,,0,0,I absolutely love Ben and Jerrys ice cream it is expensive for the amount you get but it is delicious and it has a huge variety of flavors to choose from. Compared to other brands this has more cheesecake bites then ice cream bites.

44_bj,Sarahmarie,2017-08-20,5,In love,11,2,I've been a huge fan of Phish food for 15 or more years. It's been my favorite. But this blew me away. I saw another reviewer state the cookie swirl was too coarse or possibly crystallized. I love the courseness of the cookie swirl it tastes amazing and adds a different texture to all the soft goeyness. I bought and finished this ice cream in the same day. THANK YOU! I always go back to Phish Food. But this I will definitely be going back to.
44_bj,,2017-12-12,5,Best icecream I've ever had,13,1,"Haven't been big on icecream in my life time. Only flavor I cared for was cookies and cream. Had no idea I'd LOVE Choc flavor, and mixed with the carmel, such a divine combination. The cookie swirl is mouth watering. The cookie dough is exquisite; although țhe peanut butter dough is also scrumptious, I could live without much of it in the pint. I've gotten pints with very little of the PB dough, which is heavenly. I've also gotten pints with lots and lots of PB dough, which I find to be a bit overwhelming. Still, it's the flavor I always reach for. Still consider my FAV of all time. Thank you Ben & Jerry's, & Jimmy Fallon for perfecting a flavor so awesome."
44_bj,Brittany,2017-07-30,5,Ohhh emmm geeeee,8,0,Honestly all I have to say is this is the best icecream I've ever had. It had gobs of amazement in it. Like wow.

Everything But The... used to be my favorite flavor but they have definitely changed the formula there and I stopped buying it because all I could taste was my bitter memories of how it used to be. So glad I have a replacement flavor that I love even more!!"
44_bj,dough believer,2017-04-13,5,Sooo Good,15,0,"I cannot stop talking to myself with my mouth full of ice cream saying, ""O my gawd, sooo good!"""
44_bj,austin1chase,2018-05-23,2,Why did they change the flavor :( :( !!,5,4,"This ice cream is to be our favorite. We probably right once a week for a year. However the last five we have purchased have had a new taste to it of some sort of fruit, and it has ruined the flavor. We waited A few weeks to that that that sent out, and then we went and bought some more , But it was still the same weird through the aftertaste. For the aftertaste doesn't belong anywhere near brownies or cookies or chocolate ice cream or Oreos. It's gross. Please change the recipe back to the original !!!!!!! We have switched to a different brand of ice cream for now."
44_bj,LLHh,2018-05-22,2,Excellent...except for weird PB cookie dough,7,9,I purchased tonight dough a few months ago and everything about it was great. This time the PB cookie dough was horrible. It tastes almost like an artificial banana flavor or how I would image nail polish would taste. Here is a photo of the batch numbers.
44_bj,Andarra,2020-07-06,5,THE BEST ICE CREAM ON EARTH,0,0,I love this ice cream more than any other ice cream on planet earth. There has never been an ice cream that compares to this... If I could keep a giant deep freezer full of The Tonight Dough I would be pretty happy. Eating it makes me feel like Unicorns Dolphins Glitter are flying around my tastebuds. This may be dramatic but it's my addiction.... I can eat it in one sitting.... Its even better as a milkshake using vanilla oat milk. I love it so much. I actually hate chocolate ice cream but this is my major exception...I used to buy this every other day.. so yeah its PERFECT. Also the money goes to a good cause when I buy.
44_bj,nyfluttergirl,2018-03-30,2,I really want to love it :(,6,1,The first time I bought this flavor it was amazing! But the last few times the peanut butter dough has ruined it. It tastes rancid. I keep giving it chances because I love everything else about it. But I had one last night that was rancid tasting PB again and my pile of PB chunks in the end was about 1/4 of the container worth. I don't believe I'll be giving it any more chances this time.

44_bj,Kait11,2018-07-31,2,What is Wrong with that “Peanut Butter” Dough?,5,0,This ice cream is great except for the disgusting peanut butter dough chunks that taste like eating a ball of Splenda mixed with dish soap. Seems like maybe there is a bad batch going around? The rest of the pint is great... not sure what’s up.
44_bj,TonightDoughisthebest,2017-04-27,5,The greatest flavor ever!,2,1,"I purchased Tonight Dough in a Ben and Jerry's shop hefe in Hawaii a few months ago... OMG it is the greatest flavor I have ever tasted! I am not even an ice cream person, but when I found out that my local grocery store carried the Tonight Dough in pints- I was hooked! The base of this ice cream is mostly chocolate with some caramel ice cream. Then you have globs of chocolate chip cookie and peanut butter cookie dough. There is also swirls of thick chocolate fudge and tiny chuck of chocolate sandwich cookie pieces! The best way to eat this is to let it melt a bit and swirl it all around to mix up the choclate fudge and chocolate sandwich cookie peices. Great Job Ben and Jerry's - and Jimmy Falon! Honestly the only ice cream I will eat!"
44_bj,Arliffy,2018-01-02,3,"Awesome except for ""peanut butter"" dough",4,1,"This is a great ice cream in almost every way: the ice creams are delicious and the crunchy cookie swirls are awesome. The regular cookie dough with mini chocolate chips is also delicious. I was taken aback by the ""peanut butter dough"" though - it tasted really artificial, almost a bit rancid? I ate a few and had to pick the rest out. One of my friends was eating it too and felt the same. Please consider changing the PB dough or removing it altogether."
44_bj,Dizzy,2017-06-15,5,Best Flavor Ever!,5,0,It's like heaven in my mouth from the first spoonful to the last.
44_bj,TylerJNA,2017-12-21,1,Usually one of the best,2,4,"This is usually one of my favorite flavors. Bought some yesterday, and when I went to try it the texture was icey and rough, as though it had melted and been refrozen. Little bit disappointing."

Hands down, my new favorite.
If I was a food, I'd be this!"
44_bj,ChrisColby,2018-04-15,5,So much to love!,2,0,"I'm still amazed that so many components can fit into one pint. The varied cookie dough pieces have the perfect chewiness. The rich chocolate base compliments the dough, and the cookie crumbs complete the overall theme. If I can find one flaw, it's in the caramel ice cream, which is so minimal and over-powered by the chocolate base that it might as well have just been just chocolate. Still, one of B&J's best."
44_bj,JaeDAAp,2018-06-26,4,Love the Cookie swirl,3,0,"I love this flavor so much, the chocolate cookie swirl is so good. The two icecream flavors are sooo good! But i did not like the peanut butter dough I had way to many chunks and not enough chocolate Chip cookie dough pieces."

44_bj,FuzzyGut,2018-05-31,4,Almost awesome,2,0,"I really liked most of this one. The ice creams taste great as do all the mix-ins, except the peanut butter cookie dough, which has an extremely strange flavor, and not peanut buttery. It’s kind of frustrating because the rest of it is SO good. I’ll probably stick with Half Baked instead of getting this one again."

44_bj,A_rose,2018-07-15,3,Meh,0,0,"This flavor didn't live up to my expectations. I did taste any caramel ice cream flavor, and the peanut butter cookie dough had a weird artificial flavor."
44_bj,Golfer Girl,2018-03-27,1,This was more PB Dough Than Ice Cream,4,3,I have been trying really hard to stay away from ice cream but saw this on the shelf and thought I have to try it. Boy was I disappointed. First I almost bent my spoon in half trying to break into the ice cream but that was because the cookie dough took over everything. There was hardly any ice cream in this. The dough pieces were very dry and not tasty at all. I really wish I could have liked this one. $5.00 in the garbage.
44_bj,emilyg,2017-10-11,5,Heaven in a pint,1,0,"I've been dying to try this flavor and after trying a couple not so great flavors i decided it was time. it was the best decision of my entire life. if you only eat one ice cream for the rest of your life, let it be ""the tonight dough"". the dough chunks are not ""chunks"", they're insanely huge, like nearing nestle Toulouse premade dough size. the ice creams are so good and it's just amazing. i wish they sold this one in a barrel because one pint is just not enough!"
44_bj,Cldowns81u,2018-01-25,1,Peanut butter ?,13,10,I bought this with high hopes but the peanut butter cookie dough is disgusting. Everything else is fine with it except that. It tastes NOTHING like peanut butter cookie dough. Pretty unhappy considering how much this stuff costs....
44_bj,Renaat,2019-09-09,5,Wow!!,0,0,Tasted this flavor today @ the factory in Vermont. Hope they introduce it in Holland!!!
44_bj,Mary Lu,2017-07-09,3,Great flavor but inconsistent,1,0,The first time I tried this ice cream it was amazing! I thought it was my new favorite. The second time I tried it it hardly had any cookie dough in it at all and was mostly ice cream. Then the third time I bought it it was loaded with cookie dough (yay) but was mostly all the peanut butter dough which made it too peanut buttery for me. I'm not sure why it would be inconsistent because I've never had that experience with other Ben and Jerry flavors.
44_bj,icecreamlover123,2018-09-06,5,AMAZING TASTE!,1,0,"I was never really a big fan of ice cream but that was long before I bought my first pint of 'The Tonight Dough'. Ever since I took a spoonful of this heavenly creation, I've been addicted to eating it. Being a girl is tough for about a full week, once a month. I can now happily spend that week eating this ice cream. It's my guilty pleasure. Thank you, Jimmy Fallon for helping to create the single best thing that makes life worth living."

I love Jimmy Fallon and I love ice cream...you took my 2 favorite things and put them together!! Quick question: Did he REALLY come up with this combo, cuz if he did, tell him he hit a home run with it!!....and please don't stop making/selling it!!!"
44_bj,Cree28,2017-07-21,3,Mostly Good,3,1,It was mostly good except the peanut butter cookie dough had yucky aftertaste. My husband agreed. Unfortunately most of the chunks were peanut butter so we both had significant collections at the bottom of our pints. Normally I like anything sweet but they really were a bit nasty. The rest was delicious.
44_bj,jshellenberger,2017-06-19,5,Deliciousness in a bowl,1,0,Tried this one for the first time tonight after many glowing recommendations from my girlfriend. I can't believe I waited so long to try this batch of heaven! The cookie dough and peanut butter offer a delightful chewy texture and flavor alternate with the ice chocolate and caramel ice cream.
44_bj,Keewester,2018-08-08,5,Absolutely my favorite!,2,0,"I can’t find this in my stores for the last week! It’s constant,y sold out. I may have to put on a disguise and sneak into another county! I need more!"
44_bj,,2018-01-13,3,Yum except for the PB cookie dough,3,1,"This ice cream is soooo great! It would almost say it is my favorite however the PB cookie dough has an add taste to it that makes it undesirable. Almost a freezer burnt taste. I would recommend a new recipe for the dough. Otherwise, it is great!"
44_bj,leazf913,2020-07-25,5,,0,0,"This was my first ever Ben & Jerrys ice cream and I am definitely a repeat customer of this ice cream! I dont think this ice cream could get better! Its is sooo delicious and I recommend it to everybody! I had first seen this Ice cream on the tonight show and I kinda thought it was a joke until I saw it at a gas station I quickly picked it up, purchased it, and on the way home with a plastic spoon I found (still in its plastic) I opened it up and enjoyed on the way home. It was sooo good! I have since bought 3 more containers."
44_bj,LiloLink,2018-01-02,3,"Good, except for the peanut butter dough :(",2,1,"I was really enjoying this one up until I tasted a bit of the peanut butter dough. It tastes rancid. :( I thought perhaps it was that one piece, but sure enough it tasted the same when i found another piece! Bummer. It would've gotten 5 stars from me had it not been for those funky PB dough bits, yuck! Everything else in it was fabulous."
44_bj,Erikaaaa,2018-02-01,5,Heaven?,1,0,"Is it? Heaven in a pint? Seriously... Best icecream I have ever had. I Really hope it never gets discontinued... I live in Kauai, Hawai'i only Walmart sells It. Its now the only icecream I'll eat!"
44_bj,wanderlust,2019-04-18,1,"Horrible, doesn't taste like peanut butter!",0,1,"I bought this to try as my store was out of my usual flavor and it was absolutely horrible. The chunks with peanut butter in it were gritty (like sand gritty) and tasted nothing like peanut butter, they made me gag and I had to spit it out. I spent the rest of my time eating this, picking out and trying to avoid the nasty peanut butter bits but eventually threw out about half of a container. I'm a peanut butter addict and this tasted nothing like any peanut butter I've ever had! Will not repurchase ever."
44_bj,,2020-07-27,5,,0,0,"Favorite. Flavor. Ever. This pint is for those ultimate ice cream lovers. This isnt for a cheat meal...save this for a cheat DAY, because you will not want to stop eating it once you break the seal. It is gloriously excessive in all the right ways: every single bite has loads of cookie dough, peanut butter, brownie, or chocolate cookie chunks, and the ice cream itself is swirled with more chocolate indulgence. Me and my husband buy a pint apiece because we have failed many times to share nicely!"
44_bj,sweetbluerose3,2017-05-23,5,Bomb,1,0,Absolutely my favorite Ben and Jerry's ice cream flavor so far. I have yet to find another mouth-watering ice cream flavor that will impress me. I will be trying your new non dairy products very soon. Thanks for the creativity.

44_bj,pintgobbler2000,2018-08-24,2,Muddled flavors.,0,0,"Really strange. I thought this sounded great, but the textures and flavors don't compliment each other at all. The major problem is how overpowering the chocolate is: too much raw cocoa flavor. It's way too rich for all those mix-ins. The peanut butter dough is floury and almost sickly sweet, very artificial. There's absolutely no flavor to the chocolate chip cookie dough after being doused in their chocolate base. The cookie core is oddly coarse and, in places, kind of icy."
44_bj,victor,2020-02-07,5,Cookie Doughs Best Ever,0,0,"The cookie doughs in this pint are better than I've ever tasted in other flavors. I think in particular it's the peanut butter cookie dough that WOWed me to death. The sweet caramel ice cream and the less sweet chocolate ice cream balance quite nicely. Before I tried it, I wrote ""The Tonight Dough"" off as too busy and probably not good, but now it's def like my favorite Ben & Jerry's. I can't get enough of the two cookie doughs with the chocolate ice cream."

I've been a huge fan of Phish food for 15 or more years. It's been my favorite. But this blew me away. I saw another reviewer state the cookie swirl was too coarse or possibly crystallized. I love the courseness of the cookie swirl it tastes amazing and adds a different texture to all the soft goeyness. I bought and finished this ice cream in the same day. THANK YOU! I always go back to Phish Food. But this I will definitely be going back to."

With caramel & chocolate ice creams with chocolate cookie swirls & gobs of chocolate chip cookie dough & peanut butter cookie dough, the peanut butter flavor isnt overpowering, and the caramel ice cream is dreamy! When you feel like eating an entire carton of ice cream to make your chocolatey dreams come true, try this."

Any time I have enough money, I always try to grab a pint or two because its just so dang delicious. I can't remember what turned me onto Tonight Dough, but it's been my soulmate for nearly 2 years now. If I can't find my baby, I usually settle for Half Baked, but The Tonight Dough will always be at the top of the totem pole for me. ♡♡♡♡♡"

I had Tonight Dough for the first time at a work function where Ben and Jerry’s catered desert . I cannot stop thinking about this ice cream. I crave it and get myself 1 pint as a treat when I grocery shop, but I could eat it every day! It’s been almost a year now and my love has only grown for this treat!"
44_bj,Maddiejunk,2017-11-29,2,Not enough dough,1,2,I always buy ben and Jerrys and I tried this new type of pint and I am very offended. There was not enough ice cream as I expected in my pint. It was around half full and I was very upsset. This pint was not worth as much as I spent on it. I am a very good customer and this is my favorite ice cream and I wish this was prevented.
44_bj,Tanguera,2018-09-04,2,Tastes a little weird,1,1,"I’m a big B&J fan, but The Tonight Dough doesn’t work for me. The peanut butter cookie dough tastes like it’s gone bad which is shocking because I love all things peanut butter. I also usually like having a blend of flavors, but the combo is just weird."
44_bj,narayaesub,2020-07-29,5,,0,0,Okay so when I was young I thought Ben and Jerrys was just so expensive and a treat I could not indulge in. I love ice cream and this is hands down the best store bought for me.

I started at 1 pint a day and now 2, I've had to compensate by adding more time at the gym but it's worth it. I love that there's no pieces of nuts they are too hard for me. I love to let it melt and sip it then eat all the dough that sunk to the bottom. Mmmmmm!"

I've gotten pints with very little of the peanut butter dough, which is heavenly. I've also gotten pints with lots and lots of peanut butter dough, which I find to be a bit overwhelming. Still, it's the flavour I always reach for."

I bought chocolate syrup when i bought this flavor cuz I was in the mood for chocolaty awesomeness but I didn't even end up using the syrup because the ice cream disappeared before I remembered it was there.

44_bj,katieg108,2020-01-05,5,,0,0,Ben and Jerrys is known in my family as the best Ice cream around. When a carton of half baked is placed in my freezer I know it will not last more than a week! I absolutely love this flavor! It has a perfect hint of saltiness in the dough and creamy sweetness in the ice cream! This is far superior to half baked because the different doughs in this mixture are much better!

There is no sharing when it comes to Ben & Jerry's The Tonight Dough Ice Cream
44_bj,,2020-07-24,4,,0,0,Its nice and creamy and the chunks give it an added boost of flavor. I usually try to control myself and tell myself that I will only get a scoop but next thing I know the pint is gone. Its reasonably priced so you can afford to stock up on a few of the favs for later. They keep really well unlike some that tend to get freezer burn easily.

Its not my first choice but I do enjoy it when I dont have my usual brand in stock at my local store. As Ive said if you are a fan of cookie dough this might be your next favorite flavor
44_bj,leslies65a5,2020-07-26,5,,0,0,This is the best combination of vanilla chocolate and cookie doughI love cookie dough. I can sit and eat an entire pint. Youre able to taste and savor each flavor. You can never go wrong with a little tiny pieces of chocolate bits so good. It is a little pricey about 4 to 5 dollars for a pint but definitely worth it.
44_bj,michelleb3082,2020-06-15,5,,0,0,"Ben & Jerry's tonight dough is basically one of the only ice creams I will eat, it is to die for. It combineschocolateandcaramelice creams withchocolate chip cookie dough,peanut butter cookie doughand a crunchychocolatecookie swirl. It is so good! if you haven't tried it you definitely need to get some immediately!!"
44_bj,yai_martinez17,2020-05-03,5,,0,0,"This would definitely be my favorite Ben and Jerry's ice cream. I got it once to try and see if I liked it, since I'm not really an ice cream person, and I fell in love. It's one of the best flavors Ben and Jerry's offers. The two ice cream flavors and the two types of cookie dough just really complement each other."
44_bj,roshh1,2019-07-20,5,,0,0,"Let me start by saying WOW!! I had to force myself to stop eating this, or I would have consumed the whole pint. This flavor has now become my favorite! I had been looking for a tasty dairy free ice cream (Im lactose intolerant) but what the heck, Ill just take my pill before enjoying this deliciousness! Buy it!"
44_bj,tarlanella,2020-03-06,5,,0,0,This flavor is a party in your mouth. Whoever thought to blend a mixture of so many chocolate favorites is a genius and deserves an award. I am a repeat customer and have purchased this pint of cream 20+ times in my lifetime. I recommend to ALL my friends. I love this flavor so much. Its 100% a guilty pleasure.
44_bj,Mya788,2020-04-12,5,Absolutely to die for!!!,0,0,"I’ve been buying this same ice cream for years. It’s the perfect mixture of cookie dough and cookie pieces. It’s not too salty or too sweet. I can’t keep my hands from buying it off the shelves which is probably why my New Years resolution isn’t going to great lol. Nonetheless, I hope they never get rid of it."
44_bj,faspee,2018-09-09,5,,0,0,This is the second time I've bought this brand and it was also well worth the money. I will buy this again for sure! It's very good for that girls night out and you need that comfort food. So many yummy chunks cookie dough and peanut butter cookie dough. Satisfaction was achieved after this was consumed.
44_bj,jennyw50,2020-07-30,4,,0,0,"I got to try this for my first time recently. I love the variety in there with chocolate, caramel, COOKIE DOUGH!! Anything with cookie dough has my vote. The peanut butter conflicted with the caramel just a bit too much for me, but overall super delicious. Im happy whenever I can find B&J on sale for $4!"
44_bj,stephaniem100,2020-07-28,4,,0,0,"The perfect alternative to regular cookie dough ice cream! This has your standard chocolate chip cookie dough and peanut butter cookie dough mixed with chocolate and carmel ice cream. I gotta say my favorite part is the cookie crunch swirled in, gives you a nice crunch of texture every once in a while."
44_bj,Icecreamfan4life,2018-06-22,4,Interesting Mix,0,0,"Bought this a couple nights ago on a whim. Had seen it plenty of times when I was looking at other flavors to try out, as I'm not typically a real big chocolate ice cream fan do to the bitter taste it can have at times. But I've found that I really enjoy B&J's chocolate ice creams. Very smooth and light flavor. So I finally opted to break down and chose to buy this flavor. And have to say that I wasn't quite unsatisfied with it. I mean the chocolate and caramel ice creams came together beautifully with the chocolate chocolate chip cookie swirl. But I have to admit there was something off with the peanut butter cookie dough. I have no idea, if they taste off, do to possibly being made from a vegan recipe. But, I could very faintly taste the peanut butter as well as some kind of floral-esque note at the end. Was kind of strange tasting. I think maybe if the recipe was adjusted a bit or maybe just adding a peanut butter swirl or core to this pint, would really make everything come together."
44_bj,AJ42,2020-03-03,5,BEST FLAVOR!!!! :),0,0,"I recently went to a Ben & Jerry's store and purchased The Tonight Dough but in a milkshake and although I am lactose intolerant, this was one of the best decisions I made. This ice cream is AMAZING, and I would defiantly be buying it. Hope they make this flavor dairy free one day to help me out."
44_bj,girlwithnoclue,2020-07-25,5,,0,0,"Ben & Jerry are my two favorite men because not only are they SMASHING the patriarchy, but theyve been killing the ice cream game for years. This flavor is the most packed with toppings so be aware if you like simple ice creams! A cookie dough lovers dream, the cookie swirl is my favorite!"
44_bj,sambutneversammy,2020-06-11,5,,0,0,"I never thought I would be a fan of peanut butter cookie dough in an ice cream as I am really picky about where I taste peanut butter. However, they balance the flavors so well that I really enjoyed it! The carmel ice cream soon made me realize my love for caramel ice cream in genereal!"
44_bj,jasminemaewith,2020-07-29,4,,0,0,I have had sooooooo many flavors of Ben & Jerry's throughout my life. It is an amazing brand. There's always so many goodies jam packed into one container! And there's an insane amount of choices available. This one is pretty memorable due to Jimmy Fallon's face being on the container.
44_bj,kimsparkle,2020-07-26,5,,0,0,"Tonight Dough is my all time favorite Ben and Jerry's flavor. The mix of ingredients is the best. It has both chocolate and caramel ice cream along with chocolate chip cookie dough, peanut butter cookie dough, and a chocolate cookie swirl. It has a lot of texture and tastes great!"
44_bj,sallyw12,2020-07-02,5,,0,0,"This is by far my favorite flavor! I've tried so many different flavors and they're all good. But I like this one the best because it has some saltiness along with the sweet chocolate, cake and cookie dough flavor. I don't care about the cost, I'll pay anything for this yummy treat."

44_bj,Nephritis,2017-09-16,5,Pretty great flavor,0,0,"I bought this tonight after a long period of contemplation, and I love it! The only thing is, the chocolate cookie swirls that other reviews referenced is the single best ingredient in existence, and I personally thought it should have had more...like a separate pint of it!"
44_bj,alicer9,2019-06-23,5,,0,0,"Love the creaminess and all the toppings in the ice cream. This is my go-to pint to buy at grocery stores. It's loaded with the toppings, doesn't cheap out. The price for this product is decent but is amazing when it's on sale. Delicious and would recommend this to others."

44_bj,Blondie95,2017-06-01,5,Absolutely perfect!,0,0,I have probably tried about every ice cream Ben and jerrys sells in stores and this is the best one. The chunks of cookie dough throughout the ice cream along with the cookie crumble swirl is the best combination. It's so good that it's now the only ice cream I buy ever!!

If you feel the same way, it really doesnt get better than Ben & Jerrys. The Tonight Dough is my favorite but there are so many delicious Ben & Jerrys ice creams."
44_bj,haleymarie23,2019-09-15,5,,0,0,I absolutely love this ice cream!! It has so many different flavors all in one. I like that it has cookie dough pieces in it.

44_bj,stephaniew80,2019-09-08,5,,0,0,5 stars all day long. I ate this Ben and Jerry's flavor every single day while I was pregnant and still continue to love! No other ice cream company fills their flavor with as much goodies like b&j does. Every bite you have cookie dough and brownie swirl. Omg. The best.
44_bj,brittanyv6f03,2020-07-25,4,,0,0,"I love Ben and Jerry and their ice cream. I gave this one a 4 because yes, it's delicious, but it's not my favorite.

44_bj,jamiesc69b,2020-06-20,5,,0,0,"Delicious! There is a great chocolate to vanilla ratio. I love the fudge mixed into the chocolate, but not too rich. There are lots of cookie dough bites so you can nearly get one in every other bite. No need to search. Perfectly mixed leaving very little to be desired."
44_bj,Kirsten28,2020-09-05,5,Really Might Be The Best Ever,0,0,"This one really might be the best flavor ever.

44_bj,mottagiu,2020-06-17,5,,0,0,The dairy free Ben and Jerrys ice cream is the best in my opinion. The texture is and flavor is just like regular ice cream. I think Ben and Jerrys is a bit overpriced but its totally worth it considering that they support great causes and the flavor is immaculate

44_bj,Lindsey D,2018-05-27,5,Best thing EVER,0,0,"So, I want to start off by saying my addiction to this started on my birthday 2 years ago, I was like "" OH! I'll try this it sounds good."" And the rest was history. This ice cream has got to be my all time favorite over all other ice creams ever, from marble creamers to mom and pop stores, large brands to small brands. ALL TIME FAVORITE! I've always been the kind of girl that's more like 'Ice Cream in my toppings,' not toppings in my ice cream. This totally hits the spot! It's like Vanilla/Chocolate ice cream with ""chocolate cookie"" ribbon like swirls, and chunks of both chocolate chip cookie dough and PB cookie dough. IT IS AMAZING, so amazing that when my local grocer puts it on sale by even 0.25 its sold out before any other flavor.
As to some of the reviews saying the favor changed, I think its more the retailer your buying it from. I don't get mine from Target any more b/c they let the ice cream melt a bit before they can get it stored again. I'm pretty sure that ruins it a bit b/c it mushes the flavors all up and makes things wonkie. That's probably what happened to some of you all. When i got a few like that over a couple of months the PB tasted off, not bad, just off. Kinda like switch from JIF to Skippie or whatever they are called. Either way, I'd say try this flavor if you like Ice cream with your toppings, and are a fan of cookie dough in general."
44_bj,tonightdoughlover5,2020-06-29,5,DELICIOUS LITERALLY THE BEST THING IN THIS WORLD,0,0,"this ice cream singlehandedly provides me with 3 days worth of seratonin. every bite is pure joy, ecstasy, and transcends all human taste possibility. let’s get real here ladies THREE TYPES OF COOKIE DOUGH!!! and it’s not like most cookie dough ice cream where you’re eating for a while and go, “where’s the cookie dough??” NO!!! THERE IS COOKIE DOUGH IN EVERY BITE BRUH!!! the distribution of the cookie dough within the ice cream is my favorite part however, the ice cream itself is beautiful. because it’s not all chocolate it makes me feel a little better about stuffing it into my esophagus. The Tonight Dough is NOT just an ice cream it is a way of LIFE!!! in fact i have spent TWO YEARS searching for an ice cream that gives me the same RUSH as a spoonful of this heaven, alas none quite do the trick. If i had a chance to time travel i would travel back and give whomever came up with this concept for ice cream a BIG OLE SMOOCH!!! they truly outdid themselves. i no longer buy any any ANY other ice cream at stores because this is the ONLY ice cream worth eating. A song once said “I scream, you scream, we ALL scream for ice cream”. i will personally guarantee you NO SCREAM can match the pure HAPPINESS that RUSHES through my veins when i open the freezer and see jimmy fallon there. NOT because i love jimmy fallon but because of the pure adrenaline coursing through me at the thought of the cookie dough confection that is the TONIGHT DOUGHHH!!!! i now have a pavlovian response you mr fallon’s face. It causes me to salivate profusely. In all seriousness THIS IS THE BEST THING YOU WILL EVER EAT. I LOVE YOU BEN I LOVE YOU JERRY THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR THE PURE HAPPINESS!!!!! <3"
45_bj,Melisa,2017-09-25,5,My all time favorite,6,0,I love the surprise in every bite! Caramel and chocolate are a marriage made in heaven!! The caramel ribbons and the caramel covered chocolate bites are sinful! This is by far my all time favorite ice cream!! I drive past 5 grocery stores that carry other Ben & Jerry's Ice Cream just to go purchase this particular flavor!

The caramel-filled truffles: silly yummy! If you need lots of caramel flavor with several different textures (and some nice chocolate, too) as I often do, then this is the ice cream for you! It’ll put a nice big smile right on that mug of yours, and when was the last time you turned down a little extra happiness?"
45_bj,RB2020,2020-09-12,2,"Ice cream is good, but where is the caramel?",0,0,"I would expect a flavor called ""Triple Caramel Chunk"" to have more of a pronounced caramel flavor. The chunks were few and far between and the caramel swirl was pretty much absent. I wanted something that looks like the picture used in your glamor shots, but got something a lot closer to plain light-brown ice cream with a vague caramel0sh taste. Nothing at all like it's advertised to be."
45_bj,Sara H,2020-09-06,1,Bland,2,8,"I purchased this ice cream thinking it might tast great , reading the title, but i was very dispappointed by it!!

45_bj,barryf,2017-08-21,3,where are the chunks?,0,1,"First off, the ice cream tasted great. The problem is with the quantity of the chunks. In the pint I bought there were 4 chunks and i expected much more since many of the other great Ben and Jerry ice creams are loaded with treats. Plus I like the contrast between the ice cream and candy treats"
45_bj,AK Catherine,2017-06-13,3,"Good flavor, gritty texture.",0,1,"I was very excited to try this flavor of ice cream, however I was saddened that the ice cream wasn't rich and creamy like Ben & Jerry's usually is. The flavor was there, but it had a gritty texture. I tried to power through but after 1/4 of the pint I gave up, I couldn't get past the texture. :("

45_bj,EZ Doesit,2020-09-08,5,Savor Suggestion,0,0,"I read the review by Sara H.

46_bj,Odie McGoo,2017-07-24,5,My New Favorite,17,0,"I recently found this at my local grocer and was a little skeptical since I like bourbon (I'm from KY so by law I have to) but I'm not a big fan of caramel. I decided to give it a try but still bought my go-to flavor, Chunky Monkey, just in case this bourbon and caramel infused ice cream wasn't my cup of tea. Despite my reservations I instantly fell in love with this ice cream and now keep a pint stocked in my freezer at all times. the caramel bourbon flavor is smooth, not to rich, and the almonds pieces pair well with the flavor and chunks of chocolate. Well done Ben & Jerry. I reall hope this flavor stays in the lineup for a long while."
46_bj,GuiltyVargoIceCreamLover,2017-08-20,5,Wow...omg wow!,6,0,"It is SO good! I've been trying out new flavors instead of my stand by of chunky monkey or mint chocolate cookie. I have liked most and loved 3. But this one knocks my number one out! im not usually a Carmel fan especially the gooey kind (i usually go fudge) but wow! The only thing that I would have done differently is the nuts, i think pecans would have been in keeping with the southern theme ihis has going. But yes, I know, there is aways the pecan pie, which was just a like in my book."
46_bj,ksgirl79,2017-09-19,5,Yum!,4,0,"On a particularly lonely Sunday while I was shopping I decided to grab my normal flavor ""Everything But The..."" to give myself a little treat. Then I saw this flavor staring at me. Carmel, Almonds, and Bourbon oh my! SOLD! I hurried thru dinner so I could rip open the container to get my first spoonful. Its creamy burnt carmel taste hit me first and I couldn't stop. The almonds and chocolate made for great trio of flavor but then it happened... I hit the bourbon carmel center. Oh my goodness my mouth waters just thinking of it. I promptly took a pic and sent it to several friends telling them to find some for themselves right away. Thank you B&J for yet another addiction."
46_bj,Ja_Ja_jason,2017-04-30,5,OMG!!,7,0,Yet another amazing flavor to come out of the Ben & Jerry's flavor laboratory. I had to hide it from the wife so she wouldn't eat mine.
46_bj,Sweettooth,2017-07-08,1,Disappointed,4,18,"I normally love B&J, even if I don't love a flavor I try, I can still appreciate it. But not this time. First of all, the almonds are like flavorless splinters. The bourbon swirl tastes like bananas. And generally I like ice cream with chunks in it, but this was so overrun you can't even enjoy the ice cream. I'm whining about it because B&J might want to count the votes when deciding whether to keep making this flavor. I'm sure lots of people will try it, but I doubt you'll get a lot of repeat customers. But thanks for making such awesome ice cream (aside from this) and by the way my boyfriend LOVES your chocolate cherry Garcia. I do to. Hope you'll keep making it!"
46_bj,bikelvrgirl,2017-08-10,5,FABULOUS,3,0,"This flavor is simply not your ordinary ice cream. I enjoy a good helping of Boom Chocolatta Cookie Core now and then, but sometimes I just don't feel like something super sweet and chocolate-y. This flavor has a little bit of everything. Chunks: check. Sweetness: check. Saltiness: check. Rich, dark undertones of something mysterious: check. I love the balance of the darker, rich flavors with the salty, sweet flavors. This is the BEST! All I can say is, they better not ever get rid of it! It's addicting!"
46_bj,Curlysea87,2017-04-29,5,Yum yum yum!!,6,1,"I was a little worried about buying a new flavor because I have bought a few lately that I haven't liked and I didn't want to be let down again. But my favorite flavor is no longer available so I took a risk on this one and boy am I glad. I can't put my spoon down! The almonds, fudge flakes and caramel swirl dance in your mouth and while sometimes you get a bit of the bourbon taste it is not overpowering! Great work guys!!"
46_bj,Nance,2017-05-23,5,Just what I needed!,5,1,So happy my husband got this for me to try! He knows I love bourbon. I really love this flavor! I think u did it just right! Don't think I will share this pint. Maybe the next one. Which there will b plenty of because this is hands down my new favorite!!!! I am not a huge fan of caramel either so I was a little skeptical. But this is the perfect blend of the caramel and the almonds and the chocolate and the bourbon flavor all together. Yummmmmmmmm Nice job <3
46_bj,One For the Road,2017-07-19,1,To many nuts,1,0,"I bought this yesterday thinking I would try a 'new' flavor for Sunday dessert. I returned it today minus the spoon or two letting me know this is not a flavor for me. The first spoon was so overrun with almond 'bits' that I could not get a good taste of the ice cream. The second spoon did not prove any better. Needless to say I did not make it to the 'swirl' before deciding it had to be returned.
This was the first time I shook my head in wonder at a B&J product (wondering who came up with this; how did it make it to market as a B&J product)."
46_bj,Evan,2017-06-05,2,"I really want to like it, but I can't...",5,5,"I love Ben & Jerry's, and I've never been disappointed by a flavor until now. The burnt caramel is pretty unpleasant and the bourbon is definitely lacking. The almonds killed it for me though. After each bite the ice cream was long gone and I was still chewing up an unnecessary amount of almonds. After about six spoonfuls I couldn't take it anymore and had to scoop myself some store-brand vanilla to get the taste out of my mouth. Sorry Ben & Jerry, I love you guys but this flavor is not for me. I'll stick to my Phish food."
46_bj,Arianna,2017-08-07,1,Disappointed :(,2,2,"I was bugging my mom about how much I wanted Ben & Jerry's so when my mom took me to the store I was staring at the frozen doors drooling and I was looking at all the flavors and my usual ""half baked"" wasn't there so I grabbed Urban bourbon because it sounded delicious!! I went home and started eating it and it didn't have any flavor, all it tasted like was coldness overwhelmed by the tiny almond shreds. The only pleaseant part about this ice cream was the Carmel swirls. I wish I bought the bob Marley ice cream !! But I still love Ben & Jerry's no hate"
46_bj,Ashley547,2019-09-13,5,The best Ice cream I have ever had!,0,0,"My stepmom first introduced me to this flavor of Ice cream, and after my first taste I fell in love. I’ve been buying this flavor for about a year I think now and it never gets old! Recently I’ve heard some rumors saying that the Urban Bourbon flavor is going to be discontinued? Since I’ve heard that, I’ve been buying 3-4 tubs of it every time I go to the grocery store. I know there are thousands and maybe even millions of reviews out there, but if you happen to stumble across mine I would like to ask...could you could possibly keep Urban Bourbon as a permanent flavor? Thank you Ben and Jerry!"
46_bj,BigT03,2017-05-08,3,More Bourbon,2,0,"I think Ben and Jerry ice cream is a superior ice cream to most. When I saw urban bourbon I was really excited to combine 2 of my favorite things. I tried 2 pints, and neither had much of a bourbon flavor to them. The little bits of bourbon that I did get were very good, would have been nice to have more of it
I would have hoped for the price of a pint, the flavor would have better matched the name, feel a little taken."
46_bj,Sharon2802,2019-08-01,5,OMG -- my new favorite since Dublin Mudslide,1,0,"I instantly got addicted to this new flavor. I've been sad about Dublin Mudslide going to the graveyard for years, but I may have just found something at least equally good. Yes, it's sweet (caramel swirls), but not as sweet as any of the 'core' pints or Phish food that I do not like at all. Urban Bourbon is such a delicious combination of flavors! With the crunchy almonds, and chocolat bits it is really perfect to me. Chillin' the Roast and New York Super Fudge (one of my go-to's) seemed bland after Urban Bourbon."
46_bj,bingobungo,2017-08-24,5,The Best Caramel Ice Cream Flavor,2,0,"The ice cream is what counts - all the extras thrown in aren't going to compensate for ice cream with no flavor. This ice cream has a complex, full bodied, intense caramel/bourbon taste and is loaded with flavor notes. The thick dark chocolate flakes and almond bits accent the flavor. This was excellent - so much better than the grainy flavorless taste of the coconuts for caramel flavor. I love it."
46_bj,Traumatized by Bourbon,2017-09-11,1,Had me gagging!,2,0,The flavor sounds great in theory but it seems like it's a challenge to make consistent flavoring and distribution of ingredients. My point contained too much of a large center swirl of bourbon that was overly sweet and had me gagging. I couldn't even enjoy the perimeter and ended up tossing the entire pint before guzzling almost a liter of water! Definitely has kinks that need to be worked out.
46_bj,stupidhobbits1,2018-04-15,4,Tasty but there's no alcohol,0,0,I love the flavor and texture but was a littke annoyed when i did some research and found there wasn't any real alcohol in it even though it lists whisky as one of the ingridients. Was hoping to at least get a little buzz but was disapointed. Thought it was ice cream for grown ups but i guess not.
46_bj,JunypersDream,2017-05-20,5,Spectacular!! Hits the spot!,2,0,"I haven't eaten ice cream in months-trying to get into a health kick-but I saw this and didn't think twice before grabbing it up to by it guilt free. I am obsessed with bourbon-one of the only liquors worth drinking-so seeing an ice cream with it made my day.
If you make it into a milkshake you get more of the bourbon flavor even distributed!
Totally need to buy more!"

46_bj,itisb4me,2017-05-03,5,Excellent move Ben&Jerry's,2,0,"Ever since Heathbar was removed from your ingredients, I have been searching for a new favorite icecream. The replacement toffee just wasn't the same. Well I can say that I am glad I remained loyal because this is my new favorite icecream. This could definitely be the difference for me :)"
46_bj,Paxeth,2017-04-10,4,nice combination of flavors,2,0,"despite the name there is no ""alcoholy"" flavors. the base ice cream is delicate, the fudge chunks are rich in flavor as always, I wish there was a bit more almonds in it though as you don't get nuts in every bite and I LOVE almonds but the creamy caramel swirl smoothed me over. delicious!"
46_bj,Casey k,2017-07-15,5,Best Ever!!!,2,0,I purchased this a few days ago and now I'm hooked! This is my FAVORITE ice cream! I used to go to Bruster's a lot to buy ice cream but this one puts everything they have to shame! Thanks so much for this wonderful new flavor and I hope you keep this one on the market!!! :)
46_bj,Suzanne,2017-09-30,2,I will never know,0,2,"Let me begin by saying that I am a serious B&J fan, lately consuming whole pints in a day. Unfortunately, as far as this flavor is concerned, epileptics like me don’t dare try it because of the whiskey (even in tiny amounts, alcohol is a very potent seizure trigger). A recovering alcoholic friend of mine said the same thing, that it could trigger a craving that could undo all his work. Delicious ice cream is not a good reason to spend a night in the hospital. Assurances from B&J isn’t enough, folks, how about an alcohol-free version? (I don’t even like bourbon very much, but a gin-flavor will probably do me in, LOL.)"
46_bj,Chenson,2017-07-01,5,Awesome taste!!,2,0,I am loving the new flavors. By far this ia my favorite. im not big on chocolate in my ice cream so i was skeptical on this flavor. To my surprise its perfect! Tiny little flakes and perfect amount of almonds. The bourbon taste is spot on not to overwhelming but noticable.
46_bj,handerson286,2017-04-19,5,So yum!,2,0,Just found this in the freezer at my in-laws' and I gave it a try. Usually caramel is so sweet in ice cream but this was unlike anything I've had before. The balance of flavor was perfect. The chocolate flakes and almonds were plentiful in every bite. Highly recommended!
46_bj,Brodiecat,2017-04-23,5,Addiction in a pint,2,0,"This stuff is amazingly good. And addictive. I chose this new flavor on a whim, not to my boyfriends liking. He is now addicted. I agree, it's probably a new favorite. But he can't stop eating it... Great blend of flavors. Whoever came up with this needs an award."
46_bj,Jodi143,2019-04-03,5,Mmmm Sultry,0,0,My absolute favorite. My local stores aren't selling this anymore! I'm so sad.
46_bj,stezeph,2017-07-14,5,Amazing,2,0,"I don't understand some of the not so great reviews...I'm not even a fan of ice cream without a lot of chocolate in it...but this...wow...What an awesome difference from something totally chocolate.
Go for it. Can't miss with this. YUM."
46_bj,Yvonne,2017-05-05,5,Perfection!,2,0,I tried this flavor when it arrived on the shelves at my grocery store. I am HOOKED!! The amount of almonds and chocolate chunks pairs exactly with the burnt caramel and bourbon. I can't imagine a more perfect icecream!!!!
46_bj,Bostbosox,2017-08-13,5,Addicted!!,2,0,"Can't get enough! Love it. The burnt caramel base flavor is awesome, almonds and fudge the perfect mix ins, but the whiskey flavor is the straw that stirs the drink. Awesome"
46_bj,jessh,2018-04-10,5,Not your typical ice cream fix,0,0,"I bought this flavor on a whim one time when stocking up on my most recent favorite the Tonight Dough. I was shocked, the burnt caramel flavor mixed with chocolate and bourbon flavors was an instant hit the minute it hit my taste buds. I am normally a chocolate ice cream kind of gal through and through. But this was sooo good and different from anything I had ever had and it still cured that sweet tooth of mine. I've already bought this several more times and introduced it to so many friends who love it as well! In this case change is a good thing!!"
46_bj,Ima Scooper,2017-07-14,5,Soooo Happy!!!,2,0,"While I still mourn the passing of Tennessee Mud long ago my new boozy ice cream headache fix is Urban Bourbon. It's a fun mix of sweet, burnt and boozy!"
46_bj,Mary44429,2017-07-15,5,Yum,2,0,"I was so excited to try this and i love it. Probably because it Has all my favorite things in it- nuts, caramel, bourbon. Mmm :)"
46_bj,Phish Food Fan,2018-08-12,5,Different and really good,1,0,"I had this one once and didn’t like it, but I wanted to give it another chance and bought it again, and I’m glad I did. It’s really actually quite good when it gets a little melty. The ice cream flavor itself is somewhat subtle and the fudge chunks are really great. The bourbon caramel swirl is delicious! I will definitely buy this flavor again."
46_bj,Icecream fan,2017-05-14,5,Delicious,3,1,Just ate this for breakfast. Great way to start the day. Not being sarcastic
46_bj,KellyDEN,2017-07-14,5,Love it!,2,1,LOVE this flavor. Ben & Jerry's knocked it out of the ballpark. I picked this up at the grocery store because it's new and I like caramel. When I got home I attempted to take a taste of it and ended up eating half the pint! I love the unique bourbon and caramel flavors and the crunch of the chocolate and almonds.
46_bj,Dejota,2017-08-22,1,If I could give zero stars,3,2,"If I could give zero stars, I would. I love Bourbon but this ice cream was gross. I got barely a quarter of a pint done and had to throw it out. Luckily I went out the next night and found gen and jerry's One Love and that made up for it."
46_bj,Tinkerbelle,2018-09-29,5,I'm so addicted!!,0,0,"After trying this ice cream nothing can compare..no other flavors, not gelato, nothing!! I cannot eat just a scoop. Once I start eating it the next thing you know I'm at the bottom of the container. Only thing that would make this better is a larger size container!!
The last two times I went in my Kroger the shelf was empty..no Urban Bourbon! Today when I went they had a sign saying it was on closeout. I bought all 8 containers they had. Please Ben & Jerry's don't send this flavor to the graveyard!!!"
46_bj,Puck,2018-10-18,1,Too much burnt flavor,0,0,"I wanted to love this flavor. EVERYTHING in the ingredients were things that I liked individually. Except... the 'burnt caramel ice cream'. All I can taste is that burnt flavor, sadly, and it overwhelms everything else. I understand wanting to try a combination that isn't so sweet in every aspect... but sadly, the burnt aspect of it drowns out the other elements to the point I can't taste anything else in much the same respect that several of their coffee flavored iced creams do for me. A shame."
46_bj,Paul55,2017-05-26,1,No distinct flavor,2,1,"I bought this for my husband who loves anything bourbon flavored. He couldn't wait to try it and was very disappointed. He said it had no flavor at all that he could tell, it was just overly sweet. There was certainly no flavor of bourbon."
46_bj,Nannerama,2018-01-31,5,What I've been looking for!,1,0,I just bought this tonight and am happily surprised. I have been going from flavor to flavor and brand to brand looking for just the right chunky and carmelly combo. And the bourbon is the cherry on top! Thank you for making the best out there.
46_bj,Kimberly,2017-05-20,3,It's OK,2,1,"It's fine, but it didn't wow me. The flavors are all just too muted, for some reason. But, it was 90 degrees in the city today, so I'm not too unhappy about it. I'm just glad I have ice cream to cool me down."
46_bj,Pattynoone,2017-04-16,4,Very out of the ordinary!,1,0,"This has everything I look for in an ice cream, but more! I've never had this flavor of ice cream. My only complaint is, I actually think it has too many almonds! But that's better than having too few!"
46_bj,LadyD,2017-05-01,3,A tweak could make it better,1,0,This ice cream is ok. I think if it was made with salted caramel and a few less almonds it would be great. The bourbon swirls are tasty. I was a little disappointed in this flavor.
46_bj,Beekeeni,2017-07-22,1,Too sweet and too burnt,8,14,"At about the second bite, on top of the extreme sweetness, there's a strong overly ""toasty"" taste. I felt that they overplayed the burnt caramel. At least there's soft notes of nuttiness at the end."
46_bj,Aj_mac,2017-06-26,5,Masterpiece of flavor,1,0,"This one is a keeper, so good. The bourbon and the caramel go together so well. Almonds come through too. Chocolate chunks should be smaller."

46_bj,Cerie,2018-03-06,5,Please keep this one!,0,0,"This is my absolute favorite Ben and Jerry's flavor. I'm worried with some of the negative reviews that this flavor might get pulled, but please don't! I don't really understand some of the other reviews that are basically calling for this to be pulled from the shelves because some of the flavors are more unique. Everyone has different tastes, and I'm sure they would be perfectly satisfied with something like triple caramel chunk, why does that mean urban bourbon has to go? Part of the reason I love Ben and Jerry's is because they have more creative flavors than the typical chocolate, vanilla, caramel etc. you find with other brands. There's nothing wrong with liking basic caramel and cookie dough flavors, they're a classic for a reason, but I don't understand why everything on the market has to fit into that cookie cutter mold."
46_bj,Dawnatella,2017-05-23,3,Is 2.5 an option?,1,1,Omit the almonds and this would be a 4.5! The almonds are tiny and get in the way. The hinder the flavor. I like when ice cream is smooth going down. Now it feels grainy. The flavor otherwise is good and the bourbon caramel is amazing. The chocolate is slightly too dry. I think they need to use the phish food fudge recipe instead.
46_bj,Reese,2017-07-06,4,"Great flavors, but...",1,1,"Bought a pint 3 days ago, love the flavors, but the almonds are too finely chopped for me, they get stuck in the corners of the mouth & in between teeth. I found myself focusing on trying to avoid the annoying almond pieces (impossible) instead of really enjoying the great taste of the ice cream, fudge, & bourbon Carmel swirl."
46_bj,,2017-12-11,5,Sooooooo goood!,0,0,"My wife brought this home. She drinks bourbon, I do not. This is by FAR our favorite flavor ice cream! Even though I don't drink, you can really taste the bourbon in the caramel. But it's not a bitter alcohol taste. And the dark chocolate chips are the perfect sweet/bitter combination to compliment the burnt caramel and bourbon. Not too overly sweet like most ice cream. I really hope this flavor is around for a really long time!"
46_bj,Dana,2017-06-08,2,Disappointed,1,1,"I usually love Ben & Jerrys but I was disappointed with this one. Everything in the ice cream including the bourbon flavor had actually sank to the bottom of the container. So 95% of it was basically pretty blah tasting and the other 5% was overwhelming, which of course you couldn't eat."
46_bj,Ice cream maven,2017-10-27,5,It's mine!,0,0,"I was standing in front of the refrigerator debating over what flavor ice cream to get when Urban Bourbon caught my eye. I love alcohol flavored sweets and warned the family that they might have to get their own pint. ""It has caramel"" they said ""You don't like caramel"" but it's Ben & Jerry's I replied. They didn't listen and now they wish they had because this perfectly blended flavor frenzy is only mine!"
46_bj,laurie,2018-04-10,5,My first taste of Ben & Jerry's,0,0,"So my first taste of Ben & Jerry's was Urban Bourbon ice cream. I ate the whole thing in one sitting! I have tried to say away from it because it is soooo good and I have no will power to put it down. Luckily for me the stores around me have stopped carrying this flavor but, I still look for it when I am out shopping. I know if I happen to come across it again it will be coming home with me."

46_bj,belhud,2017-04-30,2,Just okay...,1,1,"Just tried your new flavor, it's just okay, not my cup of tea. I didn't get any bourbon flavor at all, would have been better with roasted almonds, way too many fudge ""chunks"". Still a B&J fan though!"

I honestly didn't have high hopes based on the flavor description, but then I tried it and wow! Definitely my new favorite flavor! I thought all of the elements worked really well together and felt that the ""burnt "" caramel flavor wasn't overwhelming like I had initially feared. Great work!"

It’s not overly sweet but the flecks of almond and perfect crunch to the dark chocolate. I’m addicted to the caramel swirl... I’m telling you as a Ben and Jerry’s fan - YOU MUST TRY THIS FLAVOUR okay I’m off to buy some more okay thanks bye
46_bj,forest sprite,2017-08-23,5,"""Urban Bourbon"" is delicious!",1,1,We absolutely love this new ice cream-and hope you guys will keep Urban Bourbon as a permanent flavor! Its the best caramel ice cream out there and we can't get enough of it!
46_bj,jjcovarr,2017-10-05,2,Not the best flavor,0,0,"I was really when I saw this flavor. I was debating between Phish Food and this one. I have had Phish Food before, so I gave this one a try. There seemed to be a lack of flavor and it didn't really have an ice cream taste to it. It was not horrible, I was just nor impressed with it. I usually like the new flavors that Ben & Jerry's release, but this one just did not cut it."
46_bj,Yackersmaren,2017-08-23,5,HOLY YUM!!!! DID I SAY YUM??? YES YUM!!!,1,1,Urban Bourbon is my new favorite. The flavors just melt together in a happy little dance in your mouth. It was all gone before I knew it!!YUM YUM YUM!!!!

That was only a half pint. When I finished it a few days later, same thing happened. Ha, ha. I learned my lesson.
I have eaten many of your other flavors without an issue. But Urban Bourbon, i'll steer clear of."
46_bj,Rwntree,2017-07-28,5,"Not perfect, but well worth a try",0,0,"Not a perfect replacement for my old favorite, Bonnaroo Buzz. But it's still great. In reality this is a 4.5 stars for me, but that's not an option. The reason: not enough Bourbon flavor. It's there, but you really have to try to find it. That really is the only downside for me. All things considered, this is a nice blend and I hope it stays around a while."
46_bj,Two Spoons Johnny,2017-12-14,5,Best Caramel Ever,0,0,"I am not an avid caramel consumer, but this product has converted me, at least for ice cream. There is something magical about the combination of flavors here. I am a huge fan of New York Super Fudge Chunk flavor and can't find that any longer. This one is my new go-to flavor at any point. My second is tongue twister Truffle Kerfuffle."

Hope you aren't stopping the production of this flavor!!!"
46_bj,FuzzyGut,2018-06-24,3,Not my thing but I can see it being for others,0,0,"I did not love this flavor but it’s not because of a defective pint. I just personally didn’t care for it but I can see why other people would love it. It sounded perfect to me but for some reason, it just did t do it for me. But hey, everyone has their tastes and I can understand why people love this one. Just not me."
46_bj,musicalmystic,2017-10-06,2,Not what the title suggests,0,1,"I was really looking forward to this flavor. I am a huge fan of Ben and Jerry's and a huge fan of bourbon, so it seemed like a dream come true. Unfortunately it was not at all what I'd hoped. It was so different than I expected that I actually bought a second one just to make sure; alas, both were the same. First off the ice cream didn't have that caramel taste one associates with bourbon; to me it tasted like coffee ice cream. It wasn't bad tasting, it just wasn't bourbon flavored. Also there were a LOT of chopped almonds in it, so many that it completely dominates the taste and texture of the ice cream. It seemed as though half the volume of the carton consisted of almonds. Now if they had labeled this ""Almond Ice Cream with mild coffee flavor"", at least I wouldn't have gotten my hopes up. Again, it's not bad (if you like nuts in your ice cream, which I don't), but it's not bourbon either. There are lots of Ben and Jerry's flavors I crave; this is not going to be one of them."
46_bj,kabrion,2019-01-07,5,What a flavor.,0,0,"I bought this because it sounded weird enough to be good and it was way better than good. It is nutty, sweet, slightly burnt but not overwhelmingly so, the chunks and swirls were perfectly balanced with each other and the ice cream. 12/10. I will cry myself to sleep id it should ever be pulled from shelves."
46_bj,SquamLoon,2017-09-03,5,My new favoriite flavor,0,0,"Not too sweet; not too burnt; not too bourbony—but enough of all of the above to taste decadent. Having happened upon it elsewhere and immediately fallen in love, I requested this in my local grocery store, and I'm happy to say that it;'s been selling like hotcakes, so I think they'll keep ordering it."
46_bj,AmyM,2017-05-25,5,Urban Bourbon Oh How I Love You!,0,1,Just bought it today. Tried a spoonful and was skeptical it wasn't going to really taste like Bourbon. I was proved wrong. It's deliciously sinful. I do wish you could omit the almonds and add more bourbon. Well done!! Maybe B n J should try something with Bailey's or a Tequila Margarita ice :)
46_bj,ShawnCHI,2017-07-19,5,Best one yet!,0,0,"This is probably my favorite flavor from Ben & Jerry's. I've pretty sure I've single-handedly bought all the Urban Bourbon from my local grocery store.
The nutty flavor paired with the bits of nuts and chocolate just absolutely makes my day at the end of a work day.
MORE LIKE THIS PLEASE."
46_bj,SuzanneRae,2018-08-30,5,All-time favorite Ben & Jerry's flavor!,0,0,"I'm in love with the burnt caramel ice cream in this flavor! The bourbon caramel swirls, chocolate chunks, and almond pieces put it over the top. The ice cream is complex and sophisticated. Probably not for kids. ; ) It was all I could do not to eat the whole pint in one sitting!"
46_bj,Invain63,2018-05-12,5,More! More!,0,0,"I have been looking for a replacement for my dearly departed Oatmeal Cookie Chunk and then out of the blue came Urban Bourbon! It is a wonderfully complex and not too sweet pint of delight. On the down side, now I can't find it any more either. Is B&J trying to make me crazy?"
46_bj,petri33,2017-07-31,5,"Unique flavors, great combination",0,0,"This might be my new favorite Ben and Jerry's flavor! The burnt caramel ice cream is fantastic, and you can really taste the bourbon in the caramel swirls. The chocolate chunks are an excellent combo with the caramel, and the almond bits add a last bit of nice texture."
46_bj,Connie1217,2018-01-25,5,Love Love Love It!!,0,0,"This may be my new favorite flavor. I usually go for the Chunky Monkey, but saw this at the grocery store the other day and decided to give it a try, since I have recently switched from vodkas to whiskey and bourbons. Absolutely love everything about this flavor."
46_bj,Pris13ie,2019-11-27,5,Great Blend of Sweets,0,0,"This is my new favorite B&J!! The Bourdon swirl is perfect and I am quite surprised by how well the textured complimented one another. I do, however think the chocolate pieces could be smaller pieces and less portion of the pint. Otherwise, what an amazing mix."
46_bj,Kate,2017-04-18,5,Totally Unexpected,0,0,Just tried this flavor and it is great! Unlike some caramel ice cream it's not overwhelmingly sweet... there were fudge chunks and almonds in every bite and the caramel swirl was so well flavored that it had me checking the carton for alcohol content! Loved it!
46_bj,Princesca,2017-07-17,5,Angels showed up!!,0,0,"Okay, not really...but close. It was the best ice cream I've ever had!! And I'm a very good judge of ice cream. Not to sweet, well balanced. Great size of chocolate chunks & almond pieces. Smooth bourbon flavor. Delish!! Please don't EVER get rid of this!!"
46_bj,adelina,2017-10-19,1,"Sounded great, but dissapointed.",0,1,The ice cream & swirl were good. But the almond bits were like little annoying tasteless splinters. And what kind of chocolate flakes are these? The chocolate in chunky monkey is great. This chocolate barely has a chocolate taste and no chocolate feel at all.
46_bj,Kmiller,2018-01-19,5,I am in love!,0,0,This might be my favorite ice cream ever! I am addicted! I have always liked Ben & Jerry's but I've never been a regular consumer until this one. The crunch of the almonds and the chocolate with the caramel ice cream is perfect. Please don't let this one go!
46_bj,nyishaj123,2017-08-03,5,Caramel Love at 1st Taste,0,0,"I usually hate caramel flavor ice cream because it's extremely sweet. However, this made me a believer. It has the perfect balance of sweet and alcohol and nuttiness with pop of dark chocolate. I love love love this flavor. Please don't discontinue it."
46_bj,sydney,2018-01-15,1,Awful,0,1,"I didnt like Urban Bourbon AT ALL. IMO there were way too many chocolate pieces. They were too big, they didn't melt and they had no flavor. And the texture of the almonds was terrible. They made the ice cream taste gritty. The carmel was cloying."
46_bj,Elle,2017-08-30,5,Bestest EVER!,0,0,"Went out on a limb, usually I stick with my peanut butter ice creams. Holy cow!!! Seriously! THE MOST AMAZING ice cream EVER! The whole thing is the best concoction ever put together! Absolutely in LOVE! Please never stop making this flavor!"
46_bj,Makeupmom,2017-04-15,3,Really good,0,1,"It's good but I'm more a chocolate gal. Too much almonds. Which isn't a bad thing if it came with almond joys. ;) it IS good but not MY cup of tea. For the person who ventures outside the chocolate and coconut and creams, you'll love it."
46_bj,Chelle,2018-07-07,1,Not satisfied.,0,1,"I just purchased this about 30 minutes ago to try. I do not like it. It tastes bitter and the after taste is worse. It’s too bad I can’t take it back to the store for a refund. Have to throw it away, like my money to purchase this."
46_bj,Mrvampire,2018-03-01,5,Will never cheat again!,0,0,As a huge b&J fan I have gone through so many of flavours and continue to keep it mixed up and varied but since trying this one - I think I’m going to settle down! Absolutely gorgeous - I could spend the rest of my life with this one
46_bj,Curly,2017-08-21,5,Urban Bourbon...Best Flavor Ever!!!,0,0,First bite and it was love!! Please... I beg you... never ever stop making Urban Bourbon!! Happiness is just a spoonful away in my freezer! Friends and family love it too. We all agree this is the best ice cream we ever tasted!!!!
46_bj,Drsuzannec,2018-01-29,5,Love it!,0,0,"Urban Bourbon has the best texture! The nuts are chopped really small which enables you to get some in every bite. It took me a little while, but the bourbon caramel totally grew on me and now this flavor is one of my favorites."
46_bj,SWLiver,2018-10-24,1,Top sweet and little flavor,0,0,"I have an enormous sweet tooth, and I rarely think anything is too sweet. I've also never been disappointed with any of the many B&J flavors I've eaten. That said, this was too sweet and had VERY little flavor. Cloyingly sweet."
46_bj,,2018-04-27,2,Do not purchase if you like Almonds,0,0,"This has too many fudge flakes, which I thought is was dark chocolate. What Almonds? They just have chopped almonds that you will think are tiny pieces a fudge flakes/dark chocolate. The caramel ice cream and caramel were fine."
46_bj,babybunnychrissy,2017-10-17,1,"Oh, NO!",0,3,We bought this with the new Truffle flavor. First bite it taste burnt as all get out. 2nd bite was a burnt alcohol taste. I couldn't stand it. And neither could my 3 year old who loves all flavors if ice cream- even coffee!
46_bj,Gabby,2017-10-17,2,Too many nuts,0,0,I tried this since my fav flavor was out of stock. At first I liked it but as I took each bite I realized how I disliked all the nut slivers that were in each spoonful. There wasn’t enough bourbon caramel and too many nuts!
46_bj,Jilly123,2017-07-01,5,Amazing!,0,0,I absolutely loved Urban Bourbon! I had every intention of eating just one serving but surprisingly when I looked down it was gone. Had to stop on the way home the next night to get more. Thanks for another great flavor!
46_bj,Yumm,2017-05-17,4,"New fave, but...",0,1,"Got this when it was on BOGO because I love borboun and Ben and Jerrys. Oh man was it amazing! Only had a few bites with borboun flavor though... wish there was more. Otherwise, the combination of flavors was spot on!"
46_bj,Elise,2017-07-22,5,Awesome!,0,0,I took a chance on this flavor as I don't eat ice cream very often. IMHO I absolutely loved this flavor. The bourbon is very mild and the flavors came together very well. I had to stop my self from eating half a pint!
46_bj,Emily56757,2018-02-06,5,Whoa. Second best flavor after Coffee Toffee,0,0,"All you need to say is “burnt caramel” and I’m sold. Though I don’t taste much bourbon the chocolate flakes, almonds and caramel pair wonderfully for a wonderfully interesting depth of flavors. Thank you Ben and Jerry"
46_bj,Josh from VT,2017-07-15,2,Dissapointed,0,1,"Great idea for a flavor, but unfortunately too many+too small almond pieces. The base and fudge flakes are nice, but it's still kind of plain. The swirl is very good, but there was almost none present in my pint."
46_bj,Micaela,2017-12-09,5,Really tastes like bourbon,0,0,"When I usually try things labeled bourbon, I assume it will be kind of bourbony. The first bite I took of this I got the hints of ""burnt"" smoky flavor off the top and then the splash of bourbon and caramel. SO GOOD"
46_bj,Suri,2017-09-22,1,No bourbon taste,0,0,"I don't taste any bourbon at all. It was just an overly sweet unpleasant caramel flavor. My family did not enjoy this. The fudge flakes are a distraction and too large and hard. Good idea, but not a unique taste."
46_bj,K2rite,2017-11-08,5,Love at first site,0,0,I was excited to try this flavor because I never buy Ben&Jerry but this is my new favorite. Every bite I took was exciting. All of the ingredients were equally amounted. I hope this flavor sticks around!
46_bj,Kati,2017-10-20,5,Oh My!!,0,0,Just now tried the Urban Bourbon flavor that I bought 2 weeks ago. It is BEYOND amazing. I may just have to find something to binge watch so I can eat the whole pint! I will be going back for more.
46_bj,AJWoS,2017-10-02,5,Best ice cream I've ever had. Period.,0,0,This needs to stick around as a regular flavor! Everyone I've had try this thinks it's incredible. The slight taste of burbon in the swirls is out of this world!! Hands down my favorite of all time.
46_bj,Tonks,2018-02-09,1,Bourbon?,0,1,"When I opened the pint there was a huge blob of caramel at the top and then....nothing. A few chocolate chunks, but no more caramel, a few chocolate chunks and no ""bourbon"". It was disappointing."
46_bj,Neeecola,2017-10-24,5,AMAZING This ice cream saved my life,0,0,Literally one of the best things to ever go into my mouth. Honestly everything you do in your ice cream ventures is inspiring. You paint masterpieces for the taste pallet and for that i thank you
46_bj,Unsatisfied,2018-10-13,2,Not that great,0,0,The burnt caramel ice cream was soo overwhelming at first and not very pleasant at all. It left a horrible aftertaste. I won't be buying this flavor again but I'm excited to try other flavors.
46_bj,Fleurfairy,2020-04-29,1,Just no,0,2,The ice cream itself is very grainy. Almost a sherbert texture. Not creamy at all. Way too much bittersweet chocolate chips and not enough caramel. I didn’t taste any bourbon either. Big fail.
46_bj,ZionzMom,2017-05-19,5,This hits ALL sides of the sweet tooth!,0,0,"I literally eat this just about EVERY night. It's delicious & had the perfect blend of smooth/crunchy. I don't even typically like chocolate ice cream, but Urban Bourbon is put of this world."
46_bj,Dee dee,2017-08-19,5,Hooked,0,0,My favorite flavor used to be in New York New York now it's urban bourbon I love the caramel center the fudge this is the best ice cream I have ever eaten I eat it at least once a week
46_bj,Meemee,2019-03-20,5,Delicious!,0,0,"This is my new favorite flavor, since I can't peach cobbler anywhere anymore. I'm a sucker for ice cream with nuts and appreciate the meld of caramel, chocolate, and walnut flavors."
46_bj,Kaylan,2017-05-01,5,The best Ben and Jerry's flavor!,0,0,All the flavors go so well together. The chocolate and especially the almonds both have different hardness which means the crunch is so satisfying. Easily my favorite flavor so far.
46_bj,Cammie,2017-09-06,2,Somewhat disappointed,0,0,"My first taste was great, but the ice cream had too much almond meal in it, and not enough burnt taste or bourbon taste. I loved the chocolate flakes, but I wouldn't buy it again"
46_bj,Redhead7000,2017-06-04,5,Great texture,0,0,"So, I'm not a big fan of ice cream but when my husband brought this home I decided to give it a try. I finally found an ice cream that I LOVE! It has great texture and flavor."
46_bj,Chippie,2018-03-06,5,Most yummy!,0,0,For me replaces the previous bourbon flavor that i feel that was just to hard fpr people to pronounce! Seems that they got a good one w/this one! I hope its a keeper for awhile!
46_bj,CMclaughlin83,2017-06-08,4,Urban yum,0,0,"I'm really enjoying this ice cream but I'm wondering if I should worry about the whiskey, I am pregnant. I'm sure its not a big deal but curious couldn't find any warnings."
46_bj,Cmmcleod,2018-05-26,5,New favorite,0,0,"I eat A LOT of B&J...this is hands down my new favorite. Texturally, I’m not sure it needs the almonds AND fudge chips, but the flavor more than makes up for it. Cheers!"
46_bj,bonfirebo,2017-12-21,5,Flavor perfection!,0,0,"I love that the almonds pieces are small and fully incorporated! The ""burnt"" caramel is absolute perfection and the bourbon swirl....well, it doesn't get any better!"
46_bj,Twinkle toes,2017-10-19,3,Disappointing texture,0,0,Delicious new flavor but the almonds are pulverized and in every bite. It pretty much ruins the creaminess I want from ice cream. It's a bummer. I won't buy again.
46_bj,AngieP,2017-04-10,5,Fell in love at the first bite.,0,0,Bought this tonight at Walmart. The ice cream actually tastes like hazelnut to me. It had luscious chunks of chocolate in every bite. Will definitely buy again.
46_bj,Abigail224,2018-04-17,5,All time favorite,0,0,The Tonight Dough was a long running favorite until I sank my spoon into a pint of urban bourbon. Hands down the best ice cream I’ve had from Ben & Jerry’s.
46_bj,Island Girl,2017-08-24,1,Why Barley ?!,0,0,So sad this contains Barley so it's a no go for a celiac. So many of your flavors have Barley now. Guess I'm just out of luck with my old favorite brand.
46_bj,ihlini,2018-11-20,3,Pleasant..not exciting,0,0,"Bought mostly for a different taste; not exciting, lotsa almond slices. These, made me happy though. Good caramel and not overly chocolate (big bonus) :)"
46_bj,danashopgirl,2018-03-21,5,"By Far, the best!",0,0,I decided to give this a try and fell in love! This has the right mix of caramel and Chocolate pieces and the flavor is JUST right. Highly recommend!

46_bj,starkrawzen,2019-07-22,5,Love Toasty flavor,0,0,Love this so much. The toasty burnt flavor of the ice cream is awesome and nice balance with the gooey swirl. I hope this never goes away
46_bj,Redshoes56,2018-03-02,5,Delicious!,0,0,Very decadent and a perfect treat. The bourbon flavor is not too strong (fine by me). Love the deep caramel and the crunch from the nuts!

46_bj,CJMTESV,2017-08-29,1,What happened?,0,0,I had this flavor a few months ago and loved it. Call me crazy...but I swear it didn't have almonds before. I hate almonds in ice cream.
46_bj,rebakay,2018-04-09,5,My absolute favorite,0,0,I was a little skeptical on seeing a bourbon flavored ice cream... but wow! This is amazing! They can't keep it in the stores here!
46_bj,Debb,2017-08-10,2,Don't think I'll get this again,0,0,The Almonds are very small and soft. Not very enjoyable. I had bought it for my Husband but he doesn't like nut so he took mine.

47_bj,FuzzyGut,2018-11-17,5,The best Vanilla you’ll ever eat!,4,1,"I mean it, folks! This is by far the best Vanilla ice cream available. It doesn’t get better. It’s creamy, dense, sweet, rich and very natural tasting. It’s the essence of Vanilla; very intense. It also has a great mouth feel. Yes, it isn’t full of chunks, swirls and mix-ins but that doesn’t mean it’s boring. On the contrary, each bite is an exploration of what it means to taste true Vanilla. Honestly it’s the best."
47_bj,joank,2018-04-17,5,Best vanilla ice cream out there,5,1,"My favorite ice cream flavor is vanilla. Simple, sweet, savory, creamy, delicious vanilla. I've tried dozens of fancy/gourmet brands of vanilla and always come back to Ben & Jerry's. It's got great vanilla flavor and just the right amount of salt to the cream to make this savory and not bland at all."
47_bj,KimPete,2017-05-28,5,The BEST,10,3,"The best vanilla ice cream ever! It doesn't need anything added, it's great all by itself."
47_bj,,2019-08-29,5,True Vanilla,1,0,Great Flavor! Vanilla Beans! Nothing else added. Its a great flavor when you want something simple.
47_bj,mai432,2018-05-13,5,"Excellent taste, texture, and appearance!",1,1,"My favorite flavor is vanilla that has vanilla bean. Almost every evening after dinner, I have one-third pint of Ben & Jerry's vanilla ice cream. In my mouth, it feels creamy and melts at a medium pace allowing me to savor the full vanilla flavor. This vanilla ice cream is perfect in every way. Thank you."

48_bj,GiGiT,2019-11-03,1,Mine wasn't swirled,1,4,"I must have gotten a bad batch. Mine looks nothing like the photo. I got vanilla ice cream with a glob caramel core. It was awful. I ate a little to see if the swirls would show up, but no. It was just vanilla ice cream. I threw the rest away. Complete waste of money. Very disappointed."
48_bj,FlavorFinder,2018-01-28,5,Stay Away...... It’s all Mine!,6,0,"I’m 62 and have loved B&J ice creams since first invented. I’ve probably cut a year or two off my life and don’t mind abit. Why? Because of this particular flavor combination. It’s the bees knees & the cats meow all rolled up into one sweet swirl. Once you try this, your flavor dreams will be fulfilled forever. This is the only B&J flavor combination I’d every want to be stranded on a desert island with, just me and my Vanilla-Caramel-Fudge Swirl! This is the creamiest, fudgiest, carameliest, tastiest, smoothest ice evermade. Dont wait, just go get some and enjoy every last lick!"
48_bj,FuzzyGut,2018-06-18,5,Simply perfect!,6,0,I LOVE this flavor. It is flawless with just the right amount of caramel and fudge against the vanilla ice cream. Please never alter or retire this flavor!

This is the only B&J's flavor that I continue to eat....haven't liked the new flavors for many years, and some of the older flavors now lack quality (ex: Cherry Garcia, NYSFC, and CC Cookie Dough). Please do not retire Vanilla Caramel Fudge!!!"

The simple mix of caramel and chocolate sauce with the vanilla ice cream is just perfect."
48_bj,Icecream10,2018-07-15,5,Most Perfect Flavor,0,0,I found this flavor in my local market about a month ago and it instantly became my all time favorite!! Creamy vanilla ice cream and caramel and fudge rippled all through it smooth creamy perfection straight out of the container!! Ice cream dream come true thank you Ben & Jerry’s
48_bj,Terri,2018-04-02,5,#1,0,0,"The greatest flavor, so creamy with lovely fudge and caramel generously infused. Only problem can never find it at the local grocery store which I don’t understand because they NEVER have it. Did B&G quit making this flavor? The only flavor I like and it’s never available :(:("
48_bj,Gotta Have It,2018-01-25,5,Nothing but the Best,0,0,"This is my all time favorite B & J ice cream. I was very disappointed when it ended up in the Flavor Graveyard, but was then resurrected. I like to think it was because of me and my diligent feedback to B & J to resurrect it. Probably not, but one can think."

48_bj,myvice70,2018-10-12,5,Best Combination and Mindful of the Ying and Yang,0,1,"I love many Ben & Jerry's flavors but this is by far my favorite. Vanilla base of goodness with it's simple yumminess complimented by generous amounts of two of the greatest flavors ever combined, caramel and fudge!"
48_bj,florida20,2020-08-03,5,Amazing Flavor,0,0,I found this 2 months ago and can't get enough. Has nice amounts of both fudge and caramel. Reminds me of the old vanilla fudge swirl ice creams that you can't find anymore. But this one gives you caramel too!

Although I’ve noticed lately the cookie “core” isn’t much of a core anymore rather than just a little piece. I’m pretty disappointed as I’ve gone far enough to write a review. I posted a picture to show how small it’s become. This is with me eating around it, by the way."
49_bj,BJLUVER,2017-07-07,4,"Fun consistencies, good flavors",5,0,"Now this is one of the few cores I've taken a liking to. The consistency of the cookie core is in an interesting one....smooth enough, but not exactly ""cookie-like,"" however, this does not mean it is not good. This ice cream can become quite a bit as you move towards the bottom of the pint, but I think if you're a seasoned ice cream veteran you could power through to the end. I do however wish there was a bit more vanilla to counteract the cookie core and mocha flavors, but this isn't exactly a complaint; perhaps my pint had a somewhat skewed ratio of vanilla:cookie:mocha."
49_bj,ANDRE,2019-04-10,5,boomchocolatta with brownie core,19,2,THIS ICE CREAM IS THE BEST YET OUT OF THE B@J'S SMOOTH DECEDANT COOKIE CORE COLLECTION! I TRIED THE BROWNIE BATTER BUT THERE WASN'T ENOUGH BATTER TO PLEASE! BUT THIS ONE HAS THE RIGHT AMOUNT OF EVERYTHING IN IT AND THE CORE IS A BUTTERY CHOCOLATY COOKIE BONANZA!! TRY IT AND U WON'T STOP! I'VE EATEN A PINT EVERY NIGHT FOR TWO WEEKS! BE CAREFUL YOU'LL GET HOT AND HUNGARY FOR THIS ONE AND IF U HAVE TO YOU'LL PAWN A DIAMOND RING FOR THIS ADDICTION! HEHE! ANDRE'
49_bj,KJ92,2017-06-14,5,Thank you for the locator!,14,1,"This is my all time favorite flavor from B&J, and after an exceptionally grating day, I went to my local grocer to find this pint, only to find (for the third visit this month) that it wasn't there... Defeated, I searched the flavor and came across the locator page on the website and found not one, but ten different places nearby had it! Tears were shed, angels sang, the day was quite literally saved by Ben and Jerry, and their Boom Chocolata flavor. Thanks so much"
49_bj,FuzzyGut,2018-11-27,3,50/50,5,2,"I love both sides of the ice cream! Both absolutely delicious! The mocha is to die for and the chocolate cookie and fudge flakes make for great textural and flavor components. That’s the first ‘50’ in the title of my review. The second ‘50’ is the core. While it was thick and went all the way to the bottom, the flavor is just frankly very unpleasant in my opinion. The texture of the core is also strange; gritty, grainy, hard and pasty. If this were a standard pint, not a Core, it would be a total knockout 100% awesome pint which I would buy regularly. As it is though, I think I’m done."
49_bj,Jlhluvsbnj,2020-03-11,5,Phenomenal dual ice creams & delicious cookie core,3,0,"I just tried this for the first time and I am absolutely hooked! I could live without the fudge chips, but the rest of the concoction is above reproach. The caramel side is delicate & flavorful all on its own, the mocha side is a fantastic coffee kick with subtle notes of rich chocolate. The chocolate cookie core is very true to delicious cookie consistency, I did not find any issue with the texture or taste, and I'm very sensitive. This may well be my favorite Ben & Jerry's flavor ever. I'll weep hysterically in the streets if it is discontinued. 11/10 stars"
49_bj,Juju_H,2017-06-13,5,SOOO awesome!,17,0,My all-time fave!!! Please don't ever discontinue!
49_bj,vanna,2017-12-16,5,Beautifully Designed Flavor,5,0,"When I took my first bite of mocha, caramel, and cookie core all on the spoon together my eyes closed and it was like I was one of those actors on a commercial that lick their lips, and the backdrop is clouds. Then I kept eating, and the cookie core never ended. It was the the best ice-cream-eating experience I've ever had.
Thank you for this flavor Ben & Jerry's. Thank you for your ice cream."
49_bj,Michael,2018-08-17,3,Decent But Needs Work,2,22,"This ice cream flavor is great but there are a few problems with it.
Overall it's quite delicious, but quickly turns the smile into a frown."
49_bj,Megan,2017-05-16,5,AMAZING!!!,4,0,I just recently found this ice cream and I absolutely love it but I can't find it anymore in stores. Please tell me it's not going away?
49_bj,,2017-05-22,5,Keep this flavor forever,4,0,Didn't know what to expect when I bought this about a month ago but know I crave it all the time. Best flavor so far
49_bj,Dragonborn,2017-11-08,2,Acrid flavor in cookie core,1,5,This particular flavor was disappointing because the cookie core and cookie chunks were an acrid flavor. I've been trying to finish the pint not wanting to be wasteful but the cookie is def off. Never had to leave anything less than 5 star for every other flavor tho. Love you guys!!
49_bj,Herheatherness,2020-02-23,5,My all-time favorite in the history of ice cream!,2,0,I buy this two or three times a week. I absolutely love it! I’m concerned though. The local drug store quit carrying it a few months ago and now my local grocery store has a “close out” sign on the display. PLEASE don’t tell me this flavor is being discontinued! I don’t want to live in a world without Boom Chocolatta Cookie Core!
49_bj,IceCream4eva,2017-08-02,5,AH-MAIZ-IIIIINNNNNGGGGG,1,0,"This is my absolute favorite ice cream flavor. I will choose it over every other flavor time and time again. I cannot imagine ever getting bored of this ice cream. It has the perfect ratio of chocolate to coffee and the core!!!!!! Oh, the core... it is exquisite. I can eat this by the bucket loads. Ben and Jerry's won me over with this flavor. They have other good ones too but they pale in comparison to my beloved Boom Chocolatta!"
49_bj,emlittle89,2019-04-27,5,New favorite flavor!!,1,0,This is hands down my favorite flavor! I go through phases every few years where I am extremely loyal to one flavor and will refuse to venture out. Eventually a flavor comes out that might sound like it could be good and I’ll give it a shot. Oh this was SO worth it. I am currently going through minimum a pint a week! AHH!
49_bj,Karah,2017-07-16,5,Cookie core gets me every time,1,0,I feel so bad for all the other flavours because I can't go past this amazing combo. The cookie core is hard but crumbly when applied with enough pressure and the texture is kind of gritty - it's fantastic! i try hard not to eat it all in one go but I can't stop the cookie train once it's started.
49_bj,Fire1180,2017-04-12,5,Exquisite,1,0,The Exquisite taste as well as texture all goes so smoothly with each other that it makes the perfect combination of an extreme delightful explosion of taste in your mouth. It almost has a hint of like a coffee type of flavoring but not to a broad of a taste it's just exquisite.
49_bj,MissChocolatta,2020-02-14,5,Where are you boom chocolates?,1,0,"Have you guys stopped making these? I can't find these any stores here in Cary, NC. I love this ice cream and this is the only icecream I have been eating for that past 5 years. Please don't stop making it. The cookie core is the best of the best part. From your most loyal fan."
49_bj,hola,2018-06-29,3,Meh.,1,0,"I never thought I wouldn't like one of B&J ice creams, but this one might be the one. The cookie core has a sandy texture and a weird flavour I cannot describe. It doesn'e even taste like cookies.
The ice creams themselves (minus the cookie core) are great."
49_bj,uniqueoverly,2017-10-24,5,ABSOLUTELY THE BEST,1,0,i can't explain how happy i am that you guys have created this magnificent flavor. the burst of chocolate chunks and mocha flavor and the oh so wonderful cookie core. there's nothing more perfect that i'd rather put in my mouth
49_bj,CharlieBone,2018-08-22,5,My favourite,1,0,"By far the best flavor you guys have ever produced but I haven't been able to find it in Australia for a while now. Why did you guys discontinue it?? :( Is there any way at all I can get more, I am desperate here!!! </3"
49_bj,Pete,2017-07-17,2,Where did the core go?,1,0,"Flavor is on point. When ""Boom Chocolatta"" first came out the core was huge and went straight to the bottom, now it's like a narrow funnel. Starts small and get's smaller with every bite. Bring back the full cores!"
49_bj,AtomicHoney,2017-07-25,5,Totally in love with this flavor,1,0,"As someone who loves coffee and chocolate, this ice cream rocked my world. The cookie core is addicting and the subtle gentleness of the caramel ice cream marries every element of this flavor perfectly."

49_bj,kennykinns,2017-06-24,5,The best,1,0,"Seriously this has been a favorite for a long time. Lots of flavors and textures and the cookie core is AMAZING LIKE BLENDED OREOS BUT BETTER. Really fantastic ice cream, that never gets old."

49_bj,Phanie,2017-07-24,5,My absolute favorite!,1,0,I could eat this flavor everyday forever! It has just the right flavor combination and the cookie core is by far the best core out of them all. The texture is just right! Yum!
49_bj,KatB,2017-07-15,5,One of the best core flavors!,1,0,"I love this core flavor! The center tastes just like ground up oreos, and it compliments the mocha and caramel ice creams very well. Highly recommended!"

49_bj,Milkshak3,2019-06-11,5,Best Boom Ever!!!,0,0,"This is my number one favorite ice cream ever! Please do not discontinue. When I bought this for the first time, I just couldn't stop buying it. The caramel ice cream with the chocolate mocha ice cream is such a perfect combination. It's so good to the point where I couldn't even make it home to freezer I had to eat it on the way. I would purchase it everyday if I could but it's so hard to find where I live in the country. I'm exaggerating a bit okay at least every week."

Or at least it's the one that I buy every time I see it, because it's hard to find in my area. I've always gotten it at Target, but they seem to have replaced the cookie core flavors with the new cookie dough core flavors. Don't get me wrong, I am loving these new cookie dough core flavors too. But I miss my Boom Chocolatta. :( I was getting nervous they might have retired it. :O Thank goodness it appears that's not the case!"
49_bj,,2017-12-02,5,Sooo yummy!,0,0,"I have bought this flavor more times than I can count. I love the gritty texture of the chocolate cookie core and pretty much carve it out and save it until the very end. I LOVE the caramel ice cream, and though I enjoy the coffee half pretty well, I have a sensitivity to caffeine so it amps me up a little too much. Obviously, that doesn't stop me from buying it and eating the entire thing! Very yummy! It was my go to before I found my love, milk and cookies."
49_bj,Lyndsay89,2017-08-05,3,Disappointed,0,1,"This is my favoritie flavors from Ben and Jerrys, but i have one problem. I love the caramel flavoring but not so much the mocha. I wish you guys would sell each flavor separately as well as together in order to satisfy both cravings. This way customers like me will be able to have a whole container of ice cream rather than buying the cookie core for one flavor and throwing the other half away."
49_bj,Madylikesdairy,2018-07-28,5,Love this! But caffeine?,0,0,"This flavor is my absolute favorite! Recently I’ve developed an intolerance to caffeine (I can have some, but not much). I just bought boom chocolatta for the first time since this development, but I can’t find anything about this ones caffeine content specifically. It’d be wonderful you guys would be willing to post the caffeine content if you ice creams, if there is any. Thank you!"
49_bj,CWick,2019-08-09,5,The Best!,0,0,"I mean it quiet literally when I say that this is the best Ben and Jerry's ever. It's the only reason I would continuously pay the high prices of this brand.

I also like that there is not My only suggestion would be to change the chocolate cookie pieces to chocolate chip cookie pieces, as the core is pretty much the same flavor as the chocolate cookie pieces. It is so good! More chocolate chips please!"
49_bj,atik,2017-11-16,4,Solid flavor,0,0,"The cookie core is great. It's thick and smooth with a slightly sandy texture (not a bad thing). I'm not a huge fan of coffee ice cream, but this was still enjoyable. The mocha ice cream won't take away from the other flavors in here. I wish there were more chocolate cookie mix ins."
49_bj,Jai_,2020-07-03,5,Couldn't stop eating it,0,0,"This was the first Ben and Jerry's flavor that I've tried and it's so good. The mocha ice cream goes well with the Caramel ice cream, even though it looks like it is classic vanilla and chocolate. That core is golden. It's delicious and smooth. I would eat just the core if I could."
49_bj,Lena,2020-05-28,5,Boom Chocolatta!,0,0,"My husband found this in the store along with another flavor. By far the best discovery in the ice cream section in a long time.

49_bj,Wren,2020-09-15,5,Favorite. Flavor. EVER!!!,0,0,"I love this flavor! It can be hard to find sometimes (it seems really popular) but I get it nearly every time. The taste is AMAZING!!!

49_bj,dreamer103,2017-08-13,1,What happened to the core?,0,0,"I just bought this ice cream for the first time, and was sort of disappointed. The core only lasted about 1/3 of the way down the pint and the base of the ice cream was extremely bland. I had heard good things about this ice cream so I'm not sure what happened."
49_bj,Miss Riley,2018-03-05,2,Where's the core?,0,0,"This is the BEST ice cream ever, I buy it every week, its my favorite because of the huge core... but lately the last several I have bought have had either no core at all, or a very tiny spoonful of core at the very bottom.
Not happy with it lately."

The only things that would make it better, is if the core were a little bigger, and they only put the coffee ice cream in. The caramel ice cream, while delicious, doesn't meld as well with the cookie core."
49_bj,Elliebelly,2019-07-12,5,Most addictive thing I've ever eaten,0,0,This has been my fave for a few years now. It's like chocolate heaven with a cookie core. It's not too rich like the brownie and fudge flavors. For some reason Boom chocolatta is getting hard to find. Please don't discontinue this one Ben and Jerry!
49_bj,seffie,2019-03-25,2,Not enough stuff,0,0,"Eating this right now and so disappointed. There is barely any cookie in here and the ice cream is very bland. Too smooth, needs more chunks. This is basically just coffee ice cream with a couple small pieces of cookie that barely even register."

49_bj,kimi326,2020-02-20,5,This is the Best B&J Flavor EVER,0,0,The flavor mash-uo is absolutely incredible—the mocha flavor is paired perfectly with the vanilla and melt-in-your mouth chocolate cookie core. It is drool-worthy. Thank you B&J—please never discontinue it!
49_bj,missyd03,2019-02-26,5,the best ever,0,0,Im not a huge ice cream fan. I am however a huge cookie fan and this hits the spot. it's got the right balance of flavors and the cookie is nice and smooth. on my bad part is its so hard to find in my area.
49_bj,Mary Lu,2017-07-06,5,My new favorite,0,0,This is amazing!!!!! The cookie core is so much better than traditional cookies and cream ice creams. I also love the chocolate flakes. It is really hard to find at the stores around me though :(

49_bj,Ilovecream,2019-11-19,3,Good,0,0,The store was out of the Tonight Dough so I bought this flavor instead. I am not sure if the Tonight Dough just set a really high bar or if this flavor really is mediocre.
49_bj,lalalizzo,2020-08-29,5,Fugue state,0,0,This ice cream was amazing. The flavor and the texture were perfection. Do yourself a favor and buy this ice cream immediately. Especially if you are PMSing.

50_bj,Amb123,2020-08-13,1,Tiniest amount of cookie dough of all time,37,2,"I love Ben & Jerry’s which is why I am writing this review - I feel they would care to know how disappointing this flavor is! The core in the pint I purchased was super small, making it a total disappointment. I kept digging hoping it would get bigger and it just ended up almost disappearing. The ice cream as always was delicious, but I felt I would’ve been more satisfied with my old favorite standby, half baked."
50_bj,ramsey92,2019-04-03,2,soo disappointed,44,2,i am so upset that this didnt meet any of my expectations. the cookie “dough” is just grainy sugar! not to mention i get more cookie dough out of a regular ben & jerry’s cookie dough or even half baked than what i got in this. this needs a reboot! please consider making the core out of your oringinal cookie dough recipe!
50_bj,Tillamookicecreamisbetter,2019-04-03,1,Is this a joke?,20,1,I was so excited for this because I love cookie dough but there’s never enough. I thought the core would look how it’s advertised. Spoiler alert: It didn’t. Barely any dough. Didn’t go all the way through consistently and couldn’t even be in the center. Also the dough didn’t taste great? Idk why but I like the vanilla better. Should have read the reviews first it was such a let down and I feel like I wasted my money.
50_bj,abclementine,2019-03-21,1,wish it was better,47,3,"Even after reading all the reviews that said it wasn't good I still went and bought it anyways because it looked & sounded so good, but sadly the reviews are right. most of the time with cookie dough ice cream I wish there was more cookie dough (i thought this would be the super cookie-doughy flavor i always dreamed of.. theres not even that much in it), but with this pint i actually prefer the part around the core that doesn't have any. ben & jerry if u see this please re-make this flavor with better quality cookie dough, it had so much potential"
50_bj,Phish Food Fan,2019-04-14,1,Heartbreaker,43,1,"I preordered this as soon as they announced that it was available in the online store. I was so excited to dig in but while the ice cream is delicious, the cookie dough core is terrible. Rock hard, gritty, sandy, and very inconsistent in size from the top of the pint to the bottom. I hate having to write this review, especially because the other 2 new cookie cores were pretty good, but this one is REALLY dreadful! I’m really bummed because I wanted badly to love it."
50_bj,APMNSNW,2019-02-28,1,Disappointed,46,1,"I waited and waited for this to be available at my local store. Yuck. Hard, grainy cookie dough core? This is nothing like cookie dough. Don’t be fooled, the cookie dough core is SMALL! I’m a Ben and Jerry’s fan, but you lost me here. So disappointed!"
50_bj,Icecreamlover1,2019-02-27,1,Let down,49,2,"Such a let down from Ben and Jerry’s. The cookie dough core was hard, dry, and basically tasted like granulated sugar. I am so underwhelmed by all the cores but this one was by far the most disappointing. Stick to the regular pints: my opinion best flavor is Gimme S’more."
50_bj,Mickey4,2020-09-08,1,Tasted like sweet sand.,50,4,Bought this last night and was incredibly disappointed. Never write reviews but don’t buy this. The cookie dough was literally like sweet sand. It was gritty and grainy. Threw us away after about 5 bites. I’ll stick to the original Cookie Dough.
50_bj,Magnus,2019-02-27,1,The core was a disappointment!,18,0,"I bought this, excited to try it as cookie dough is my favorite. Well the core was rock solid. It had to be eaten in 1 huge chunk instead of mixing with the ice cream. Very disappointed!"
50_bj,Deanne,2019-04-25,1,An overhyped disappointment,1,1,"I will not buy this again. It's good ice cream, but the ""core"" is a joke. People buy cookie dough ice cream for , surprise... the cookie dough. This ""core"" tastes like grainy sugar and shortening and not like cookie dough at all. And there's less than ever. The company found a way to give customers less if what they want with the hopes that all the hype about ""new and improved"" sways people. Well, I'm not fooled and I believe most others won't be either. It's overpriced and a big disappointment. I repeat, I will not buy again."
50_bj,anghearts,2019-03-07,2,Good if you like eating brown sugar,16,1,I just bought this with very high expectations because the regular Cookie Dough flavor is amazing. The cookie dough core tastes like pure brown sugar. I would definitely not buy this again unless they made it taste like the original cookie dough flavor.
50_bj,BNJ4LYFE,2019-06-05,1,Simply AWFUL - Who signed off on this?,5,0,"The idea sounded so amazing, so I did not think it could possibly be as bad as the reviews said it was...Well I was wrong, it is actually worse. The ice cream itself is fine, but the core tastes like just brown sugar crystals. Not even remotely the same flavor or texture as their normal cookie dough. Did someone actually taste this before signing off on it? This is a total miss and anyone who was fooled into buying it should be provided a refund."
50_bj,ePtiOnO,2019-03-17,1,Huge disappointment,3,0,This is not the same flavor as the well known Chocolate Chip Cookie Dough.
50_bj,Mandie,2019-04-22,1,Not much cookie dough,1,0,"I bought this at target because they didn’t have the original cookie dough I liked. It’s not good y’all. The dough seems like a new recipe. It’s got an odd texture, like sugar grains didn’t mix well and the chocolate chips are weird. The worst part is there’s not enough weird dough compared to the vanilla ice cream. I hope the old cookie dough hasn’t been replaced with this!"
50_bj,John A,2019-05-20,1,"Great concept, horrible execution",1,0,"I was really excited to see this in my grocer’s freezer. Having had karamel sutra core with its strong ratio of caramel to ice cream, I thought it would be great to get a nice glob of cookie dough going down the center of the pint. Instead, I was left incredibly disappointed with hardly any cookie dough in the entire container. Even worse, the dough included seemed to be dry and crumbly compared to what I’m used to in regular cookie dough. Very disappointing, I won’t be buying this one again unless they improve the formulation and increase the cookie dough. Worst b&j pint I’ve ever purchased."
50_bj,Happy wife happy life,2019-03-31,1,This is horrible,3,0,"The regular chocolate chip cookie dough is my favorite and has been for YEARS, its soooo BOMB!! This iteration of it is absolutely disgusting the cookie core is not dough its literally just sugar, and it doesnt even go throughout the entire pint, not even half, not even in the center , its the grossest thing .Some of the other cores are really good which is why i gave this one a try but how could you get chocolate chip cookie dough wrong . I dont normally write reviews but I felt like i HAD to warn someone."
50_bj,pirple,2019-04-07,1,Could've been better.,3,0,"When I first heard this flavor was coming out I was so excited. I waited 4 weeks to get my hands on one of these and finally found one yesterday at Wawa. I read the reviews before purchasing this, but decided to give this the benefit of the doubt. Unfortunately, everyone was right. The cookie dough has a sandy texture and crumbles to pieces and it doesn't taste very good either. Plus the core didnt even go all the way to the bottom of the container...definately wasn't worth the $5.99 I paid for it. :("
50_bj,Lyss27,2019-03-12,1,Extremely disappointed,6,0,Wow I love ben and jerrys but this one is sad. I debated between this one and another core one but chose this one due to my love of cookie dough. Well I wish I read the reviews first because they were incredibly right. Grainy cookie dough and the core in mine didn't even go half way down!!!
50_bj,bjoy917,2019-04-26,2,"Good ice cream, subpar dough",2,1,"At first I thought my taste buds were off, but no...the dough really just tastes (and feels like) brown sugar. Also, the bottom part of my pint had an air bubble, so it was hollow. Overall very disappointing. I'll just stick to the B&J's regular cookie dough ice cream!"
50_bj,Mns1275,2019-03-28,1,Save your money for a better pint,5,0,I was soooooo excited to try this!! Then I did and immediately wished I got something else. The ice cream was good but the supposed cookie dough core was like eating brown sugar and chocolate chips. It was so nasty that I ate around it. Truly disappointed....I have never been let down before so I guess there is a first time for everything.
50_bj,Hv234,2020-01-21,1,Disappointing Core,0,0,"I've never gotten a cookie dough core pint from Ben and Jerry's, but I'll never buy this again. I was expecting it to look the way the caramel core does when you open it, but instead there is such little cookie dough it would've been better to just get a regular cookie dough or half baked pint. If I'm going to spend $5 for a pint, I would at least like to get what is advertised. The same happened with my boyfriend's brownie batter core so this is not just a one time thing, but a consistent problem."
50_bj,Sammykr,2019-04-02,1,Disappointed,5,0,I have been waiting for this to come out at my grocery store. The minute I could buy it I got it. I was really upset. Like many others have said the cookie dough core is sandy and grainy. I was thinking it was going to be like the cookie dough in the normal ice cream. Really upset about this.
50_bj,Katsad,2019-03-25,1,Grainy and barely there.,2,0,I am a loyal fan and this is the one and only flavor I have thrown away. The pictures make it look amazing and I understand it’s for marketing so variation is expected. That being said the “core” is almost non existent. The bottom half of the ice cream had absolutely no core. The top half had a small chunk. The cookie dough that I did get was grainy and had a funky taste. It wasn’t cookie dough that’s for sure. The ice cream itself was creamy and had a nice flavor but I’m so disappointed that this was such a flop.
50_bj,,2019-03-28,1,Cookie dough is very grainy,6,0,Not at all like non core cookie dough which is soft and tastes really good. The core tastes terrible and has a very hard grainy texture. Not good!
50_bj,j12345,2019-06-04,1,"Boring, almost disgusting flavor!",1,0,"This is the first time I haven't been able to finish a pint of Ben & Jerry's. Tried it and threw the rest away! I love cookie dough ice cream and thought this would be great, only to be extremely disappointed! The vanilla ice cream is almost tasteless, and the cookie dough ""core"" was absolutely gross. It had none of the flavors I would expect from cookie dough, basically just sugar with a few chocolate chips. Plus, the core was half the size of the other flavors! This flavor is a HUGE miss, save yourself the trouble and try the sugar cookie core flavor instead!"
50_bj,FuzzyGut,2019-04-08,5,Chocolate chip cookie dough core! a big yes!,22,15,My order of these new pints was delivered yesterday from the Ben and Jerry’s online store and last night was Chocolate Chip Cookie dough core. it’s awesome! The ice cream really does taste like cookie milk. I’ve never had anything like it; so yummy. but the star is the core. PERFECT texture and EXCELLENT flavor. The ice cream and the core together are a match made in heaven. It’s sublime. I hope this stays for a long time.
50_bj,APMNSNW,2019-02-28,1,Disappointed,7,1,"I wait and waited for this to be available at my local store. Yuck. HARD, grainy, gritty cookie dough core. This is nothing like cookie dough. Don't be fooled the cookie dough center is SMALL. I'm a Ben & Jerry's fan, but you lost me here. So disappointed in my purchase."
50_bj,aniya28,2019-08-28,3,Cookie Dough Core,0,1,"I brought this Ice cream because I love the ben and jerry’s cookie dough, so I thought more or the goodness cookies dough. WRONG the cookie dough is not in the middle( which is not a big of a deal) and the cookie dough is gritty and taste like sugar it’s horrible. The reason it has a 3 stars is because the cookie milk ice cream is to die for, it’s just the cookie do is disgusting. This best thing if you do get this is eat around the cookie dough core"
50_bj,Kiersten,2019-03-15,1,"Love B&J, hate this flavor",3,0,"I literally stalked the grocery stores for this to come out and was so excited to snag it. Super disappointed. I’m a huge fan of B&J and cookie dough ice cream but this was terrible. Agree with other reviewers, the cookie dough was grainy and gritty. I didn’t want to throw it out so I kept eating it, but it took me well over 2 weeks to finish a pint. For context, I’m lucky if a pint lasts three days."
50_bj,Cari,2019-03-11,1,Core is Nasty,4,0,I bout the NEW COOKIE DOUGH CORE. Was not good at all when I think of cookie dough it’s soft creamy just like normal cookie dough. It’s like eating sand very big disappointment honestly and I ben&jerrys. Work on this please!
50_bj,Sadmomma13,2020-08-06,1,Buy the regular cookie dough version!!,0,0,Bought this today and was so disappointed! Cookie dough is nothing like in the reg chocolate chip cookie dough. I thought at first maybe it was supposed to have some kind of swirl in it and never found the cookie dough core like you find with the brownie batter version! It’s awful esp if you thunk your getting the cookie dough like in the reg or the bites. I would give it one star but it won’t let me.
50_bj,liz5419,2019-03-06,2,Great if you like grit,6,2,"I bought the Cookie Dough Core ice cream because I usually love chocolate chip cookie dough. While the ice cream itself was delicious ( the only reason I didn't give this 1 star), I was completely disappointed by the cookie dough core part. It was gritty and just not good. I ended up eating around it and don't even want to bother with the rest of the pint. No good!"
50_bj,Coley00,2019-02-24,3,Meh. Nothing special.,3,1,"I gave this product a 3 just because I like cookie dough. I felt like this was no different than the regular chocolate chip cookie dough ice cream. I would have liked to see more cookie dough, like maybe a chocolate chip cookie dough with a cookie dough core, maybe a half chocolate half vanilla.. I think then that would have made more sense. All the other core pint flavors are more special and different this one was boring and basic... not my favorite unfortunately."
50_bj,Jen96,2019-02-04,2,Cookie core not good,69,65,"I bought the cookie dough core and the cookie dough was crumbly when I tried to scoop it out. It was hard, had a grainy texture and didn't taste very good at all,nothing like the cookie dough in the half baked. The icecream part was good though"
50_bj,Adpqwe,2019-11-30,1,DO NOT BUY,0,0,my brother picked this up on accident instead of the regular one. This was horrible. Absolutely the worst thing I’ve tasted in my life. Grainy dry sand as “dough”. Ice cream below par. Horrible choice all around. I’ll never get that 7$ back. ROBBERY!
50_bj,hockey15,2019-06-11,3,Good but could be better,0,0,I was so so excited to try this because I love cookie dough ice cream. On one hand I want to give this product five stars because the ice cream was delicious and I personally loved the cookie dough in the middle. On the other hand I want to give it one star because it was not what I was expecting and I was still disappointed. I was really hoping for a bigger cookie dough core and I expected for there to still be chunks of cookie dough in the ice cream portion. I was hoping that this new product would finally be ice cream stuffed with cookie dough that I’ve been waiting for.
50_bj,SLange,2019-04-02,1,Should have trusted the bad reviews,1,0,Totally disappointed in this flavor. I love Ben & Jerry’s cookie dough. But the cookie dough core was terrible. First of all the core was more like a cone getting smaller the more you dug down and it didn’t go all the way down to the bottom of the pint. And the cookie dough itself was terrible it was grainy and didn’t have the same taste the cookies dough usually has. It tasted like it was heavy on brown sugar or something. It just wasn’t right. Anyway I was sorely disappointed.
50_bj,Jesspttn,2019-10-21,2,Taste very good but....,0,0,This is really good ice cream and I've had a few. However they need to put more cookie dough in the core. There is never enough. Never goes to the bottom of the carton or very little amount
50_bj,SadMomma,2019-04-07,3,Love hate relationship,0,1,I love Cookie Dough Core but so disappointing when you eat one and it has an inch of core. This was my third time buying one like the one seen in the photo.
50_bj,Chad123,2020-05-12,2,Bad,0,0,I just bought this today and when I opened it the cookie dough wasn’t even in the middle and there was barely any
50_bj,SimplyWiehl,2019-03-29,3,More like cookie butter,0,0,"We love all Ben and Jerry's ice cream. Any with cookie dough are our favorite. We were so excited to hear about this new flavor, however once we tried it we were disappointed that the core isn't cookie dough at all, but rather more like a cookie butter. It's sugary and not doughy. This was a disappointment, however it still taste good. The cookie dough ice cream is better. In addition, the dough part is not even in the middle like the photos nor does it go all the way through. Suggestion would be to have a core made out of cookie dough bites piled in the middle."
50_bj,PedNurse,2019-05-28,1,Disappointment,2,0,"Nope, Nope, Nope! You cannot fool a cookie dough expert. I had my heart set on this having a REAL cookie dough core. Much to my dismay, the core was nothing like the cookie dough in your other ice creams. :("
50_bj,MarsTheMartian,2019-11-05,4,Pretty good!,0,0,"I bought this Yesterday and immediately dug into it once I was finish eating my food, I had read some views about this before and notice they were pretty awful so I decided to never buy this until the reviews change. Well yesterday, I asked my mom could she buy me any Ben and Jerry’s I’ve Cream that had cookie dough in it and this is what she brought me, my immediate reaction was “oh no.” But hey, I didn’t mind trying it! Fast forward to when I opened the pint, there was cookie dough in the center and pretty thick(obviously you can see it in the picture) and was like, oh wow! So I decided to eat the ice cream first and I noticed it really tasted like a cookie had been soaked in some milk for about three minutes, and I was shocked because it tasted amazing! I got to the dough and remembered how one person stated it had a grainy texture, so I dug in and it did, but it didn’t really bother me THAT MUCH, it still tasted a bit like cookie dough, so I just scooped some of the dough and icecream together and that kind of made it better, I also remembered how some people said there was barely any in there but mine was PACKED with dough and it was so much that in some areas, the dough was showing more than the icecream itself! I would totally buy this again and put some of their cookie dough bites inside to make the ultimate cookie dough core flavor there is! 4/5 rating!"
50_bj,ChrisColby,2019-04-07,3,D'oh!,0,0,"After a month of waiting for this flavor, it didn't quite meet my expectations. The cookie dough core, which was supposed to be the highlight, was disappointing. The texture is too grainy while the flavor tastes off. On top of that, the core wasn't spread evenly from the top to bottom of the pint I tried."
50_bj,vickiwmi,2020-08-10,1,Worst cookie dough EVER!!,0,0,"Now let me just say that chocolate chip cookie dough ice cream is my favorite B&J flavor. I bought this new flavor about a week ago thinking it would be great. How can you go wrong with a choc chip cookie dough core I thought. Boy was I wrong. I took one bite of that cookie dough core, and went ""Blech!"" The ice cream with chocolate bits was good. That was it. What recipe they used to make this cookie dough core is not even close to the taste or consistency of the classic original. The taste is vile. I would not waste your time buying this flavor."
50_bj,Catz228,2019-08-09,1,Cookie dough taste is disgusting,0,0,If you love the cookie dough from the regular ice cream don't buy this! I don't think I've ever been this disappointed in a Ben and Jerry's flavor. The cookie dough they use for the core is completely different in the worse ways. It's mushy and taste like garbage. It's salty and weird tasting. I like lots of different kinds of cookie dough. I don't think I've ever tasted any kind of cookie dough that I've hated before. Until now. How did this pass taste testing? Good thing there was hardly any core anyway so I can still eat the ice cream part.
50_bj,wookiecookielover,2019-02-20,4,Great Cookie Dough; Needs more of it,4,7,"Kept an eye out for this in the store as soon as I heard it was coming out and bought the first one I could find. The ice cream flavor was good and the fudge chips added much needed interest to the pint. The cookie dough was delicious, although there wasn't enough of it. The core was off center and didn't go all the way to the bottom of the pint. Could be remedied by adding cookie dough chunks to the ice cream or increasing the size/quality of the core."
50_bj,reen,2019-03-24,1,Dissapointing,2,0,Like most other reviewers i found the core terrible. Bad texture and bad taste.
50_bj,Jhutch12,2019-05-11,1,Disappointed,1,0,"I bought this with so much excitement, when I took that first bite into the core, yuck! The cookie dough is just straight sugar, when you chew it your feel the grinds on your teeth. I love the chocolate chip cookie dough ice cream and that is the cookie dough I expected the core to be filled with and boy was I wrong! Do not purchase this kind, you will just end up throwing it away like I did"
50_bj,AnnieD,2019-04-27,1,That's not dough!,1,0,"I was really disappointed with the cookie dough in the core. It was dry and crumbly, not creamy and doughy like the regular CCCD. It also has an off flavor...like they spilled the vanilla when making this crusty old dough. The ice cream part was decent. I saw somebody else noted a big air bubble at the bottom. I'm had the same experience. I do not recommend and will not purchase again."
50_bj,HanC,2019-04-11,1,Bad Mistake,1,0,"My family bought this on accident thinking it was the regular cookie dough recipe. I tried it anyways and it was way too sweet. The cookie milk was not a smart move, there was nothing to offset the sweetness of the cookie dough. Cookie dough with just vanilla is much better in my opinion. Also, the cookie dough was very grainy and mostly tasted like straight up sugar."
50_bj,Mrs050716,2019-03-25,3,Mixed feelings on mix-ins,1,0,"The core is very gritty and tastes odd on its own, but tastes good with the ice cream. The sugar in the cookie dough wasn’t beaten long enough to get rid of the graininess and could’ve been so much better. The base is unique and creamy and the chocolate flakes are solid, though I wish there were more of them. Overall, a bit underwhelming with a disappointing core."
50_bj,whydoyoudothisjerry,2019-05-26,1,Not enough cookie dough,1,0,"I loooove cookie dough ice cream. When I saw the core on the package I was like “heck yes! Extra cookie dough!” Psych! There’s like NONE and it’s impossible to scoop out. Then, the cookie dough itself is disgusting! It tastes like how I imagine literal fish food would. I absolutely hate it and I genuinely think it was a waste of my money."
50_bj,bgdl26,2019-03-19,2,Very disappointed,1,1,"I was so excited to try this as I love cookie dough. Literally went to multiple different grocery stores all over NYC for weeks to find this. What a let down. The cookie dough core is not good. Very crumbly and grainy, like sand is in it. No where near the creaminess and taste of cookie dough used in Tonight Dough, Half Baked or the regular Cookie dough. Ice Cream was good at least. If you're a fan of cookie dough, skip this and hopefully they revisit the recipe."
50_bj,,2019-08-01,1,So disappointed,1,0,"I’m so sad I wasted $12 on this ice cream, I am in Australia and I was so excited to try this and i am so let down I didn’t even eat it. The cookie dough is grainy and tastes nothing like the cookie dough that’s in the rest of the flavours, and the “fudge” pieces are just dark chocolate. Do not waste your money!"
50_bj,Chefscott,2019-06-18,1,The worst cookie dough!,1,0,One of my favorite flavors is the cookie dough. Expectations were highly disappointed when the same cookie dough recipe was not in this cookie dough core flavor. I’m not even sure it’s cookie dough. I think it’s pure brown sugar. Will not buy this flavor again unless they put the original cookie dough in it!
50_bj,Ghost,2019-05-15,1,Ehh,1,0,"Im eating this flavor as we speak and the other reviews are right! Tastes NOTHING like the cookie doigh in the other flavors. It has a sandy, gritty texture like chewing on sugar. Im going to finish it though because the rest of it is alright. But yeah i’ll just stick to my favorite one , Half Baked!!!"
50_bj,Doglover88888888,2020-02-08,1,Extremely dissappointed! Don't waste your money!!,1,0,"I've bought this a few different times, each time hoping it would be better than the last. I kept thinking ""okay, I must have had bad luck and gotten a bad batch"". Unfortunately after buying approximately 5 to 6 pints, I've come to the conclusion that this just isn't good in any way. The ""cookie milk"" ice cream just tastes like regular old vanilla but with a slightly weird taste and extremely weird aftertaste. The ""cookie dough"" core (which, in my opinion, is supposed to be the best part and main attraction) was horrible! Did NOT taste like cookie dough AT ALL! Even the texture was so, soooooo off! Just like all the other reviews say - TASTES LIKE SWEETENED SAND! Now don't get my wrong - I am usually a HUGE fan of B&J's - however this particular flavor just is completely so far off from the quality I've come to know and love, and expect from this brand. This could have been an amazing and wonderful flavor but unfortunately this missed the mark. Extremely dissappointed, B&J's!! Do better!!"
50_bj,kelly1234,2019-05-10,1,awful texture,1,0,"Was so excited to try this because I love Chocolate Chip Cookie Dough. I experienced disappointment at the first bite. The Cookie Chip Dough Core was like eating super gritty sugar sand. I am hoping Ben & Jerry will switch and use their original Cookie Dough recipe in this new ""core"" ice cream."
50_bj,Shaysha,2019-03-30,2,Not quite dough texture,1,0,"The first flavor I've been disappointed with. The ""cookie dough"" core has the texture of brown sugar. When you chew it you can feel the sugar crystals. Its not the same as the cookie dough balls in the regular cookie dough pint. I did still polish off the pint though since the ice cream is good"
50_bj,Seb10,2020-03-28,1,Stick to Chocolate Chip Cookie Dough,1,0,"The ratio of cookie dough to ice cream is off. By the time you get to the bottom of the pint, all that's left is the vanilla ice cream with little chocolate bits. You're better off getting chocolate chip cookie dough which is more consistent and has a better cookie dough-to-ice cream ratio."
50_bj,Brinababy,2019-10-01,1,Cookie core is nasty,1,0,"I just had this ice cream a hour ago, the actually ice is not bad at all but the cookie dough just ruined it for me. It tasted so gritty , I thought maybe I should mix it up and it made it even worse. I ended up scooping as much of the cookie dough out that I could. Smh"
50_bj,addison20,2019-03-26,2,Ice cream: GREAT Core: BLEH,1,1,"The ice cream part is so good!! I was so excited to try this, my favorite Ben and Jerry’s flavor is half baked mostly because of the cookie dough haha. So a COOKIE DOUGH CORE I was pumped. I was so so disappointed it tasted like nothing honestly, just pure sugar and very very grainy. If they would have replicated the regular cookie dough balls into the core it could’ve been fantastic, but this just isn’t good I really wish it was :/"
50_bj,Mtan89,2019-05-10,1,Not what I expected,1,0,"Listen to the bad reviews. the core does not taste like their regular cookie dough. It tastes grainy, like brown sugar. And the rest of it is just chocolate chip ice cream. So nothing exciting. The wake and bake ice cream core was the same. Super grainy."
50_bj,Lania,2019-04-02,2,Disappointed,1,0,"The cookie milk ice cream was the only thing I liked about the product. As a cookie dough lover, I was very disappointed in the cookie dough core. It tasted nothing like cookie dough, just grainy like sugar. I’ll stick with other cookie dough varieties."

50_bj,SantaMonicaGirl,2020-01-13,5,Amazing,1,0,I love the cookie milk ice cream. I wish they would use this as the base for more flavors. The chocolate chips are also delicious and I’ve always had plenty of cookie dough in my pints. This flavor is the best!
50_bj,Catguy,2019-06-05,1,Waste of money,1,0,"AWFUL. I’m a huge fan of Ben & Jerrys cookie dough and this was such a disappointment. The cookie dough core crumbles and is as hard as a rock. It’s grainy and tastes terrible, too."
50_bj,Celine,2019-05-08,1,No core,1,0,"I bought this for the cookie dough core and there is no cookie dough core.. this is the second pint of ""core"" I've cream that didn't even have a core. I'm really disappointed."
50_bj,wren1021,2019-04-22,1,Terrible,1,0,"Ice cream tasted like artificial sweeteners and the core was nothing like cookie dough in taste or texture. Was very disappointed, totally not worth the price (or calories)"

I brought this Pint of I cream only to find that the cookie dough core was small, it wasn’t EVEN A CORE! It was off to the side, fell apart. It’s a whole scam idk why they even continue to sell this Ice cream in this condition. I should have checked the reviews. Y’all obviously don’t pay attention to customer reviews cause you would notice this is unacceptable. Smh"
50_bj,Bay boo,2019-08-15,1,Grainy “cookie dough” core,1,0,This is terrible! The cookie dough core is basically brown sugar with chocolate. I wish I could get my money back.

What a big mistake, it is disgusting. It does not taste the same and the cookie dough is awful, its grainy and basically inedible. I deeply regret straying away from the normal version and strongly recommend people read and heed the advice of the majority of other reviews here and avoid this strange disastrous flavour!"
50_bj,Crayolaphile,2019-05-16,2,Too Sweet!,0,0,"I took it upon myself to try every new flavor with chocolate in it and rate it. You’re welcome. I find the cookie dough core so sweet. IMHO the ice cream base should be vanilla. In addition, the cookie dough core should either have salted butter in it or add a little salt to mimic butter. That would cut the sweetness. Do not salted caramel or chocolate sea salt, YUCK! Anyway, just my take on it. Also, please bring back Dublin Mudslide! It was my favorite."
50_bj,cookiedoughlady,2019-03-22,5,Its a cookie dough lovers dream come true!,3,4,"Its a dream come true. Just when I thought it couldn't get better, there's more cookie dough than before. Continue to make the core as large as possible- never short change the core."

My only issue is it's not sold at my local Giant Eagle, which has B&J Core pints but there's not even a spot on their shelf for the chocolate chip cookie dough core flavor. I only get it when I'm at my mom's lol."
50_bj,heatherglow29,2019-07-08,1,Great Potential -- Poor Exection,0,0,"My all-time favorite ice cream is, hands down, original cookie dough by Ben and Jerry's. So I was thrilled to see they had a core version featuring cookie dough as its magical center. Boy was I disappointed to taste the grainy, overly sugary, poor substitute they chose to use in place of their original cookie dough recipe. Ben and Jerry, please rework this product and try using your original winner of a recipe for the cookie dough core!"
50_bj,,2019-05-27,1,Bad Texture!,0,0,"I bought this today at my local HEB, and thought I would try it since I love the chocolate chip cookie dough, honestly because I love cookie dough, but the cookie dough in this ice cream is grainy. It is hard to scoop because of the grainy texture, making it hard to actually enjoy the ice cream. The ice cream itself is amazing, but what’s the point of buying chocolate chip cookie dough ice cream, if you don’t enjoy the cookie dough."
50_bj,Kelcie,2019-08-17,1,This girl needed ice cream better than that :(,0,0,"I'm sick and all I wanted was cookie dough ice cream. I couldn't find the classic that I could always count on, so I went with this. The core was a crumbly texture and it tasted like I was eating clumps of brown sugar. The ice cream flavor just tasted like milk with unsweetened chocolate and I am not a fan of solid milk. I recomend bringing back the original cookie dough ice cream. :( Seriously so sad and disappointed."
50_bj,SueP,2019-10-10,1,Ice Cream Failure,0,0,"My husband loves all ice cream. But not this one. I gave it to him after I decided I couldn't eat it. We both agree the ice cream tastes like rice pudding with a lot of water and the cookie dough core does not taste anywhere near as delicious as Ben and Jerry's cookie dough. We haven't had a bad Ben & Jerry's flavor until this one! If you're craving cookie dough, go with any of their other cookie dough varieties."
50_bj,Homie,2020-01-02,1,Disappointed,0,0,I bought this because the store i went to didn’t have my favorite chocolate chip cookie dough pint. I figured it may be just as good since it still is cookie dough. I was wrong and extremely disappointed. The core was crispy and broke every time I tried to scoop it. The flavor was more like toasted piece of bread than cookie. I will stick with the original chocolate chip cookie dough which has never let me down.
50_bj,Potterd8,2020-04-22,3,Cookie milk ice cream,0,0,I loved the flavor of the cookie milk ice cream! I actually came to the website to see if any other flavors had that type of ice cream. Like many other reviewers I’m very disappointed by the cookie dough core. I was expecting it to be like the cookie dough ice cream but instead it was very gritty. I’m very torn on if I’d get this flavor again. I loved the ice cream flavor but really didn’t care for the “core”
50_bj,LINDZ Loves Ben,2019-07-27,2,Googled to make sure it wasn’t just me,0,0,Bought this instead of my regular go tos (half baked or brownie batter core) since it was new! I am so disappointed because the cookie dough actually does just taste like brown sugar and is gritty. I ended up here on the reviews because I googled to make sure it wasn’t just my taste buds or that there was something wrong with my purchase. Sure enough others have posted the same thing :(
50_bj,megan04,2020-01-06,5,My absolute,1,1,This ice cream is AMAZING. The flavor of the ice cream is extremely light and is loaded with chocolate chips. The core itself has a gritty texture but tastes almost identical to raw cookie dough.
50_bj,Spacecadet1,2019-10-14,1,Horrible- Gritty and Grainy and Gross,0,0,This was a perfect example of a marketing bumble. If I get a spoonful of ice cream I want each bite to have a little bit of goodness in it. I shouldn’t have to go digging for it. The “core” is nothing but a grainy sugar that is flavoured with something that vaguely represents dough. I can actually imagine the assembly line pumping out this stuff. Soooo disappointing.
50_bj,Gbizzy91,2019-04-16,5,"Cookie milk ice cream is worth it, by itself",2,3,You have to try the ice cream in this one... worth it!
50_bj,Dnwells526,2019-07-19,5,My Absolute New Favorite Flavor,1,1,I love the texture of the cookie core; it’s soft enough to eat without difficulty. The taste is AMAZING...the cookie milk ice cream is spot on.
50_bj,Daelijon,2020-08-14,2,Love it but with there was more!,0,0,"I bought the cookie dough core, and I loved the fact that there was dough all the way down to the bottom, however not all of them are the same. It seems like not enough dough to be a core of the ice cream and it’s sometimes a very thin core as well. Cookie dough ice cream is something we crave.. I would assume a product came out sooner than later that does that."
50_bj,Icecream372593,2019-05-30,1,So disappointed,0,0,I saw the ad and went to the grocery store that night to buy some. I ate around the cookie dough core bc it was so grainy and sugary and not anything like the cookie dough in the other ice creams that it wasn’t even worth it. Let’s be honest - there’s so many calories in these pints that if I’m going to eat it I need to love it and this was way below par
50_bj,Abbey96,2019-07-14,5,Ben & Jerry never let me down!!,3,7,Perfection in every dreamy creamy cookie dough-y bite!
50_bj,Danielle123,2019-04-12,2,Disappointing,0,0,I bought this pint despite the reviews because I was excited to try it for myself. All the reviews are accurate though. The ice cream itself is delicious! But the cookie dough core is not good at all. It has an almost fruity taste to it and is extremely gritty in texture. It's nothing like their normal cookie dough. Definitely won't be buying again.
50_bj,JLDJTmom,2019-04-02,1,Be warned!,0,0,I was so excited for this ice cream as chocolate chip cookie dough it my favorite..I was expecting a core of cookie dough with the same taste and texture of the bits in the regular ice cream. Instead it is gritty and doesn't even taste like cookie dough. I am extremely dissatisfied. Even my 11 year old son thinks it's terrible. Please reformulate!
50_bj,Kim123,2020-05-20,1,Off Texture,0,0,"Ben and Jerry's Ice cream has been my favorite since I was a little kid, however...this one the textures were off. The cookie dough was grainy and tasted like flour or another ingredient was missing. The ice cream was icey in texture, not creamy. I had to double check I didn't get a frozen yogurt version. Wondering if the batch was off?"
50_bj,icecream456,2019-07-14,2,the core is terrible.,0,0,"i tried this thinking that the cookie dough would be like the chunks in half baked. it was not. it was very gritty and it almost had a liquor flavor. i hated it. although it did not taste good, the core went all the way to the bottom. the ice cream was great though. that is the only reason why this is getting 2 stars instead of one."
50_bj,Cousin Vinnie,2019-05-20,2,Huge Disappointment for Life Long B&J Fan,0,0,"Everyone expects a core of cookie dough throughout, when buying it. Unfortunately, you only get a small gob in the middle. Pretty sure you get more (quality and quantity) from the regular cookie dough flavor than this core flavor.
The only reason why it didn't get a 1 star was because the cookie milk ice cream was pretty tasty."
50_bj,Windysmile,2019-11-11,2,Let down,0,0,"This was the first time I was ever disappointed by a Ben and Jerry’s pint. The milk and cookies flavor icecream was just rather plain and very sugary. I wish there was more texture going on. And the core just tasted like a ball of sugar. It was anything I couldn’t eat, but it also wasn’t anything I was enjoying eating."
50_bj,BabyBullet,2019-06-13,1,Where is the cookie dough??,0,0,I was expecting to be overwhelmed with cookie dough deliciousness however I am left wondering what went wrong. There was no “core” and really no cookie dough. The ice cream in my opinion is ok but the lack of cookie dough was super disappointing. There is way more dough in the original. My advice skip this one.
50_bj,Joyce,2019-04-26,1,Not what I expected,0,0,"I tried this thinking it would be as good as regular cookie dough. I was highly disappointed. The ""core"" was not anything like the regular cookie dough. It was very grainy and sugary. Also, the pint was not fully filled. There was an empty space about 2/3 the way down. I will not buy this product again."
50_bj,JRobertson,2019-04-08,2,Delish But Disappointing,0,0,I was soooo thrilled that it would be a core of the same cookie dough they use in Half Baked and the Tonight Dough. But it really just tasted like granulated brown sugar. I’m soooo sad about that. Because their regular chocolate chip cookie dough is the best you can find. Oh man I hope the replace it.

50_bj,Matt420,2020-02-13,3,Mehh,0,0,This really shoulda been flippin amazing. The icecream and fudge chips are great but the texture of the core does knock it down a few pegs. If it had the texture of the cookie dough used in the regular chocolate chip cookie dough/half baked it would be amazing. Overall I'd say 2.8 outta 5

However, the cookie dough itself is as if they forgot to add flour; it's like a heavy sugar stick. If it were the same dough from the cookie dough ice cream, this ice cream would EASILY be 5/5!"
50_bj,Loveleigh,2019-05-23,1,Disappointing,0,0,"The cookie dough core is a grainy sugar mess! The ice cream itself is also a huge letdown. It tastes nothing like the delicious chocolate chip ice cream in the usual cookie dough flavor. I have no desire to finish the carton, and I’ll never purchase it again."

50_bj,Jewells,2019-05-23,1,Bring back the original!,0,0,Chocolate Chip Cookie Dough used to be my FAVORITE B&J ice cream. I just tried the NEW Cookie Dough Core. The Cookie Dough in the new version has a strange taste and texture (not strange good). Please bring back the previous product. Pretty please.
50_bj,abimaybe,2019-07-17,1,Gross,0,0,This was disgusting. I expected the cookie dough from the normal ice cream or half baked and what I got was a gritty mess. The ice cream wasn’t terrible but the cookie dough solidified my feelings. Skip this. Get the normal cookie dough instead.
50_bj,amurer,2020-02-17,2,Grainy Cookie Dough,0,0,At first I thought I had a bad batch but after seeing other reviews it sounds like I’m not the only one. The cookie dough core is like eating sweet sand. The ice cream was great as always but something is very off with the cookie dough recipe

50_bj,midnitestich,2019-11-01,1,Save your money,0,0,I hope this isn't going to replace the regular chocolate chip cookie dough. It's more like a container of chocolate chip with hardly any cookie dough. The cookie dough doesn't even taste the same. I won't be buying this again
50_bj,Disappointed1,2019-08-19,1,Recipe changed,0,0,I bought this 4 days ago because I couldn’t find my regular chocolate chip cookie dough. Not only does the cookie dough recipe taste different but so does the ice cream I’m so disappointed. I will be going back to Hagen Diaz.
50_bj,Goatgirl01,2019-03-31,1,Least favorite flavor,0,0,"This is my new least fave, even worse than Schweitzer’s Balls. The ice cream doesn’t have much flavor, just sweet. The core is puny: maybe 2-3 bites. The flavor of the core is ok (the only redeeming feature) but grainy"
50_bj,37oz,2019-05-09,2,Weird cookie dough,0,0,A big letdown. The cookie dough was completely different than you would find in the non-core offering - to the point that I almost wondered if something was wrong with it. The ice cream portion was very tasty.
50_bj,Fadedtimekeeper,2019-05-16,3,It works,0,0,"The cookie dough itself is sandy ans grainy, it has an odd taste I can't really lay my finger on. But if you eat enough of the ice cream with the core it balances out a lot better and isn't as noticeable."
50_bj,martya25,2019-10-15,2,Disappointed with the core,0,0,I bought this flavor on 10/15/19. I love cookies and ice cream so I was excited to try this cookie dough center. I was expecting an actual cookie dough texture but really it’s just grainy and sugar like.
50_bj,Beth828,2019-07-08,1,Ewww,0,0,Should have read the reviews first. I don’t even mind the grainy texture of the cookie dough. But it tastes horrible! Not like cookie dough at all. This could have been amazing. Super disappointed.

50_bj,Niece,2019-08-03,1,The worst one i ever had!!,0,0,I bought one because i love cookie dough. Ben and Jerry's is my favorite icecream after one bite I was so disappointed! The texture of it was the worst I couldn't eat I throw it in the trash.
50_bj,Jody 33,2019-06-12,1,Sorry I bought it,0,0,The cookie dough core tasted more like a scoop of brown sugar with some chip chunks in it. I’m sorry but there was nothing cookie dough about it. Totally disappointed and a waste of money.
50_bj,Lacey,2019-04-28,2,Ice cream good cookie dough not so,0,0,The ice cream favor was good but the cookie dough itself didn't taste like cookie dough had grainy like texture due to too much sugar. Not what I expected out of Ben and Jerry's
50_bj,Megan411,2019-06-13,2,Great Idea with a Terrible Execution,0,1,"This is the ice cream everyone dreams, but alas, a dream it will remain. The “cookie dough” is basically just brown sugar, about the size of dime throughout. Pass this one up!"
50_bj,Radzach,2019-05-21,2,Amazing idea mediocre execution,0,0,The cookie dough was grainy and there was less than any other flavor containing cookie dough. The ice cream was great but I was expecting an amazing cookie dough core.
50_bj,Nonnahs402,2019-04-01,2,Where is the cookie dough!?,0,0,I was excited to try this ice cream. I was very disappointed. The cookie dough “core” was tiny. I think I get more cookie dough in regular chocolate chip cookie dough.
50_bj,Djal,2019-07-01,1,Barely any cookie dough,0,0,This pint tastes great but feels like it has way less cookie dough than the regular one. I waited months for this and was really disappointment.
50_bj,,2020-07-14,1,nasty,0,0,ice cream is good but the cookie dough taste like brown sugar and butter . nothing like cookie dough it’s like sand dissolving on your tongue
50_bj,Sky2222222,2020-06-10,4,Pretty good,0,0,"Tastes like cookie dough, especially good if you get a mix of the dough and the icecream compared to just eating straight at the dough. 8/10"

50_bj,CaseyT22,2020-07-10,1,PLEASE IMPROVE IT.,0,0,"I am a loyal Ben and Jerry's customer and most of their flavors are amazing and when I saw this in the store I was so excited to try it. But I am beyond disappointed in this. First I will say that the cookie milk ice cream part is DELICIOUS. I wouldn't change anything about the cookie milk ice cream. However, I was looking forward to a big center of that same delicious cookie dough that's in the other pints of ice cream (like the half baked). But instead, after digging through all the cookie milk ice cream I found a tiny little section of cookie dough, not even a core. Just a chunk on the side of cookie dough that isn't even actual cookie dough. It LITERALLY tastes like sugary sand and has a grainy texture. Nothing like the cookie dough I always enjoy in the other flavors."
51_bj,sariashi,2019-05-08,5,Ate The Entire Pint and It Made Me Less Sad,27,2,"Ummm this is the best thing I've ever eaten (probably). I've been silently waiting for cookie dough core Ben & Jerry's and this one outdid any expectations I had. All of the flavors (almond, cherry, sugar cookie, shortbread) taste like happiness on a pink cloud of soft fatty calorie heaven. Would definitely eat an entire pint in one sitting to cope with my depressed emotions again. Hoping to also eat part of a pint in one sitting while I'm happy to experience the flavors in a different mood so I will update when that happens. (Spoiler alert: still going to be 5 star rating.)"
51_bj,FuzzyGut,2019-02-11,5,Sugar cookie!,16,0,"This is great! The cherry/cherry reminds me of Cherry Garcia and the sweet cream almond is really pleasant. I was afraid the almond would be too far forward but it’s actually very well balanced. But of course, as always, the core is the star of this pint. I had to resist the urge to pry out the entire core and eat it all at once. It’s really delicious! Mine was pretty firm but it had just come out of the deep freeze so that’s understandable. I can’t wait to buy another of these.
Now onto my last one; the wake no-bake."
51_bj,cgm13,2019-07-19,5,Amazing Combination,11,1,"I have been sampling my way through the cores, and this one has absolutely been my favorite. Though I like the core itself, for me it's the ice creams and chunks that make it. I do love almond flavor, and this is done perfectly. At first glance, I thought that cookie dough/cherries/cherry ice cream/shortbread/sweet cream almond ice cream was going to be too over-the-top, but everything comes together perfectly. There's not a flavor or texture I'd leave out. We have a winner!"
51_bj,Reviewname,2019-02-15,5,Best Ice Cream,34,2,I have purchased almost 10 pints of this since discovering it. Literally the best ice cream I have ever had! Never stop making it!
51_bj,Rayofsunshines,2019-03-04,5,Becoming a Favorite!,11,1,I was intitially hesistant about this because I’m not a huge cherry fan. I do however love sugar cookies (and especially the dough). When I finally found it in a store I wasn’t sure what to expect but it was seriously amazing! I love the almond-y flavor it has to it and it actually works quite well with the cherry. Will definitely be repurchasing once this pint is gone!

I never dreamed that Ben and Jerry’s would create a better flavor. I am happy to say I was wrong. Sweet Like Sugar beats out Cherry Garcia by a nose."

The combo of flavors and textures is perfect: the touch of almond in the sweet cream on the one side and the nostalgic Cherry Garcia on the other, all tied together by the most decadent sugar cookie dough core... seriously. It can't be beat. It tastes like a bunch of classic holiday flavors combined!"
51_bj,Ash9,2019-03-30,5,Love <3,3,0,Wow. I bought this as I quickly saw something new on my way out the store and I’m glad I did. I’m not a huge chocolate fan so it’s so nice to get a non chocolate flavor!! Both “sides” are great. The cherry side is similar to a non chocolate cherry Garcia and the sweet cream side is a delightful lightly almond flavor. Love this flavor.
51_bj,Tay13,2019-04-07,5,All around perfection,3,0,This is the kind of ice cream they eat in heaven. Jumping to the top of my favorite flavor list.

Once I finally got my hands on it.... it did not disappoint! This is the most delicious ice cream ever, the almond flavor is spot on and the cherry side is loaded with luscious, large cherries. The sugar cookie dough core is wow, just wow. I love the texture of grainy sugar in a sugar cookie and this hit it right on the nail. I will definitely be repurchasing this item till the end of time!"
51_bj,ADawgMoney,2020-07-26,5,"Fantastic, well-balanced, unique",1,0,"I’m usually not motivated to leave feedback, but after tasting this ice cream, I just had to post. It is amazing! Very seldom do you taste an ice cream that is so subtly crafted, so much thought went into this one. Each of the defining characteristics plays well with each other (the cherries, the shortbread, the almond flavor, the sugar cookie), though none is overpowering. You keep going back from one flavor to another, then appreciating each even more upon return. A sense of deep creaminess and vanilla tie everything together. Great texture. If there were a comparison to be made to a layered and multi-dimensional chocolatey dessert, this would be the decadent vanilla counterpart. So satisfying, you’ll be scooping up any available pints at your local grocer before someone else finds it... I know I have. Bravo."

The flavors are subtle and delicious and make you want more! I would buy this flavor everytime, all the parts work so well together and are so balanced! My new favorite flavor for sure!!! I love the almond and cookie flavors and the cherry is just a sweet hint and not too overpowering. Seriously, please keep this flavor around!"

51_bj,Tabris,2019-06-23,5,No chocolate!,0,0,"I love chocolate, but my girlfriend haaaates it, she's always so bummed out that almost every B&J flavor has chocolate something in it, whether its chips or swirls or chunks, so she was so delighted to see this! I've never seen her finish a pint by herself before. I tried it myself and its super good, I normally don't like cherry flavored stuff but the cherry is mild and not artificial tasting at all. The almond is really good, but the sugar cookie core is the real star of the show. I say this icecream suits someone with a more sophisticated palate."
51_bj,,2019-04-27,4,"Fruity, creamy, nutty and sugary. Yum.",0,0,"Out of the 3 new cores flavors from B&J's, this one is the best. The cherry ice cream with cherries is just as tasty as in Cherry Garcia. The new sweet cream with a hint of almond flavor is extremely accurate. The almond flavor is there, adding a nuttiness to the taste while not being overpowering. And the core, while just as grainy as the the chocolate chip cookie dough pint, is at least more fitting of a sugar cookie and tastes accurate to the real deal. It's not a set of components that you'd ever imagine together, but it works. Delicious."

Amazing flavors that all stand alone when you eat it. The cookie dough was perfect and the best part. The textures in this ice cream are amazing. Super creamy, squishy cherries, soft but firm short bread, and the grittiness of the dough. Just perfection.

51_bj,Ravenane,2019-05-06,5,Delicious combination,1,0,It is like this was made just for me. It is all of my favorite flavors combined in one. The almond flavor is a good balance. It isn't too strong or overpowering. The cookies and swirl are different enough to bring their own element. I love this creation. Please don't ever let this one go. My newest addiction!

The cookie bits are a little dry, but otherwise this is my new favorite B&J flavor.

I don't know how they could make this one so delicious and fail so badly with the chocolate chip cookie dough core, but I'm not going to argue about it!"

Also, maybe you guys could consider seeing if there is a market for something fun with carob or carob chips...? Just an unrealistic dream I have.

51_bj,RKH123,2020-06-14,5,Such a great blend of flavors and textures!,0,0,"This might be my favorite Ben and Jerry's flavor. The sweet cream base with that subtle hint of almond really blends well with everything else. The smooth creamy texture mixes really well with the sugar cookie dough core and the slightly grainy texture. The cherries add yet another texture and a bit of tartness as well. If you like the pistachio flavor with the sweet cream and want more flavor and texture variety, I'd try this."

All of the flavors are balanced, the shortbread pieces are delicious, the cherries are sweet and juicy... My only complaint is that I wish the cookie dough core was more ""doughy"", as it has a sugary paste consistency instead. Every time I see this flavor, I make sure to grab two pints. Amazing!"
51_bj,LotusB,2020-02-18,5,Best Cookie Dough Core yet!!!,0,0,"One of the only flavors that I can honestly say I can eat every day. I've probably bought more than ten so far. Cherry and almond flavors are well-balanced and lovingly tied together with shortbread cookie. This ice cream showcases the beauty in simplicity, and really takes your appreciation of sweet cream to a whole new level. It is by no means as intense (or obnoxious) as other flavors, but this is what makes it shine."
51_bj,iloveicecreamss,2019-03-17,5,Best flavor ever!,0,0,"This ice cream is delicious. The almond flavor is subtle but still there, and the shortbread pieces are AMAZING. The sugar cookie dough has a great texture and flavor as well. If you love almond and/or cherry, I would definitely buy this flavor. Only downfall is that it is extremely hard to find this flavor, as I had to drive nearly 3 hours to locate a pint of the Sweet Like Sugar Cookie Dough Core Ice Cream."

I am not a big ice cream person but when I was with my husband and 3 boys they all got this and couldn’t stop talking about it. So I decided to try it and now I am hooked. It’s so addicting.
Went to the store found 4 pints left and bought all 4. Please don’t ever send to graveyard.
Thank you Ben and Jerry’s for making this flavor it’s truly the best ever. Well done!!"
51_bj,EFitz,2020-05-13,5,#1 Favorite,0,0,"This is hands down my favorite Ben & Jerry's Ice Cream Flavor. As someone who does not like chocolate, it is very hard to find an ice cream flavor that doesn't have some type of chocolate mixed in. This is just perfect! I used to eat Cherry Garcia and spit out the chocolate bits (don't call me crazy)... Well -This is a non-chocolate Cherry Garcia + Sugar Cookie dream and it is just so delicious!"
51_bj,Alex923,2019-05-14,3,"Good, but needs work",0,0,"I bought this the other day, and it was as delicious as I expected. However, I couldn't tell the difference between the almond and the cherry ice creams. If it weren't for the cherries and the shortbread pieces, I wouldn't have known there was a difference at all. Maybe toasted, salted almond slices instead of shortbread would make the almond ice cream stand out more."
51_bj,PAttyD,2020-03-30,5,Best Ice Cream Ever!,0,0,"I bought this 3 weeks ago on a whim. Sometimes chocolate just isn’t what your in the mood for! It was amazing ice cream! Every bite was deeeee licious! Then the virus hit the nation and it can’t be found ! I’m so sad ! Please keep this flavor going.... I will be buying TONS more! Love this! If you haven’t tried it, give it a whirl! You will be pleasantly surprised!"
51_bj,Sad Boy,2019-06-09,1,Not Good.,4,35,Not very good. Usually with the core ice creams they have a lot more flavor. I found that this ice cream lacked so much flavor it could barely tell the difference between to the 2 sides. Easily the worst out of the core ice creams... I was let down. Please bring back the cheesecake core!
51_bj,Marv,2019-09-24,5,Ice cream will never be the same after this flavor,0,0,"For the love of all that is good in this world, don't ever stop selling this flavor! I usually go for the chocolatey flavors, but I went out on a limb to try this recently and I might not ever go back. Buttery shortbread dough, chewy cherry chunks like in Cherry Garcia, and a tinge of amaretto, make for a chunky, chewy, creamy--oops. I ate the whole pint!"
51_bj,Lorn,2020-03-16,5,Absolutely exquisite!!!,0,0,"This is maybe the most unique option in the ice cream market today. I’ve never had anything like it. The delicate flavors of the sweet cream and almond and cherry go so nicely together, none overpowers any of the others, they just peacefully coexist. And that core. My god. I cannot quit thinking about it. It’s a sandy, almost gritty (not in a bad way—in an I cannot quit thinking about that mouthfeel way!) sugar cookie dough texture and the contrast of that against the soft smooth flavors of the ice cream..I literally cannot quit thinking about it. I just discovered this a few weeks ago and have been through three pints. I have never had any ice cream like it. I am not seeing it restocked so I’m afraid it’s discontinued and I’m going to be devastated. I’d been buying ALDI’s generic Cherry Garcia because, it’s just BETTER, sorry for the blasphemy but it’s the truth. And this brought me back to the brand. I hope it’s restocked soon."
51_bj,Christine1118,2020-02-09,5,My New Favorite!,0,0,"Just tried this flavor for the first time last month and it has now become my only favorite flavor. So much so that I’ve stocked many pints already. I love that there is no
chocolate in this as I am allergic. This flavor tops all that I’ve tried, all brands . The blend of cherry, almond shortbtrad cookie and the sugar dough core is a perfect combo."
51_bj,Lexy85,2019-04-28,5,Happy Tastebuds,0,0,"I purchased this flavor after waiting over a month for it to appear in stores! It is delightful, the flavors meld together beautifully, and are not overpowering. The cookie core is tasty, and the cherry chunks are juicy, flavorful, and plenty! The hint of almond pulls it all together for a perfect finish. I do believe I've found my new favorite!"
51_bj,chris77,2019-05-18,5,Best Ice Cream Ever!,0,0,I've been eating B&J since I was 13. This is by far my favorite Ice Cream of all time! the almond flavored base ice cream is unique and subtle but flavorful. I love how the sugar cookie dough and shortbread bits are countered by the acidity of the cherries and how that flavor profile is made more delicious combined with the almond. Well Done B&J!
51_bj,Abbygirl44,2020-02-02,5,Pleasantly surprised!,0,0,I contemplated buying this on multiple occasions but was afraid it would be too sweet. I finally gave in and was truly surprised. The cookie core was sweet but had enough buttery saltiness to make it addictive. The ice cream was subtle and perfectly balanced by the cookie core. I easily could have eaten the whole pint in one sitting
51_bj,YoAdrienne,2020-02-14,5,My new favorite flavor!,0,0,"As much as I love chocolate, it's great to have more flavor options that don't have chocolate in them. I really like the combination of almond and cherry. With the sugar cookie core, it reminds me a little bit of marzipan. (It would be great to have a flavor with actual marzipan in it. Hint. Hint.)"
51_bj,dasikins,2019-07-06,5,My all time favorite,0,0,"Cherries and surgar cookies can make the perfect concoction. For me, this ice cream tastes like sugar cookie batter (which is my peronsal all time favorite treat.) It's filled with chunks of soft cherries and cookie dough which somehow compliments each other."
51_bj,Charlie Angel,2019-06-04,5,Crazy Delicious!!!!,0,0,My new fave! This is the Bomb Cyclone of deliciousness!!! Love Sugar Cookie Dough? Sweet Cream Ice Cream? Almond Essence? Shortbread Cookies?

I am a huge fan of cherry Garcia, and PhiSh food, but this ice cream really takes the cake. The name seems misleading though because it doesn’t talk anything about the delicious scrumptious cherry which is my favorite part"
51_bj,Nickle56,2019-09-11,5,Awesome flavors come together,0,0,"I was amazed how these different flavors come together to make an absolutely delicious ice cream core flavor! I love the sweet gritty sugar of the sugar cookie dough, the taste and almond aroma, vanilla and the right amount of cherry to make this my new favorite flavor!!!"
51_bj,Shananegins85,2019-07-06,5,Warning,0,0,"If you try this ice cream, you will never stop craving it. Flavor combo is intoxicating. If you’re eating straight out of the carton there’s no way to not finish it. I had to start working out for the first time in 5+ years thanks to this deliciously infuriating ice cream."
51_bj,Dls20,2019-05-07,5,New favorite!,0,0,I was really hesitant to try this flavor for many reasons but it is AMAZING. The cherry is perfect and not overpowering and the almond flavor perfectly compliments it. The sugar cookie dough core is so much better than the chocolate chip cookie dough core.

51_bj,Embe,2020-09-09,5,Loveeee this flavor,0,1,"The two flavors are more subtle which is why I love it! I’m not a fan of super over done and sugary flavors, which this is not. The almond cookie side is my fav, I wish they just made that in a pint size. Best flavor :)"
51_bj,belleyboooo,2020-03-03,5,Great Flavor!,0,0,I bought this a month ago and I just bought another pint last week! This pint core flavor is one that is sweet but not overly sweet with this flavor combination. Hopefully won’t have to see this flavor go!
51_bj,Keoflex,2019-07-20,2,"Not outstanding, limited cherries",0,0,I decided to switch from Cherry Garcia and try this. I was super disappointed! There were only about three cherries in the entire pint and the core was way too sweet. Definitely will not buy this again.

51_bj,Gal Friday,2019-03-18,5,Absolutely delicious,0,0,This might be one of my top B&J flavors of all time. The only way it could be better would be more cherries and cookie dough in each pint. Please consider making a vegan version of this!

52_bj,,2019-08-29,5,The One Core to Rule Them All,24,1,"Open your freezer. Do you see ice cream that isn't Wake & No Bake Cookie Dough Core? That's your first mistake. Get in your car, on your bike, or in your hovercar and go to the closest store for this. Don't believe it's THAT good? That's your second mistake."
52_bj,Mariah95,2019-05-08,5,Favorite cookie as an ice cream,4,0,"When I saw this I was so excited because I’ve been making no bake cookies with my grandma years! ( hers are the best I’ve ever had ;) ) aside from that I personally like to add a little more peanut butter to the cookie mixture which would’ve been nice in this cookie core. The peanut butter cookies didn’t taste like peanut butter to me. The vanilla ice cream was fine, just subtle enough to let everything else shine. The best way to eat no bakes is while they’re still warm and not set up with a big glass of milk. I thought no bakes were an Oklahoma thing so I’m happy to see them represented in a product that’s sold worldwide."
52_bj,,2019-04-05,5,Best Core Ice Cream Yet!!,6,2,"I bought this thinking the name was just kinda funny(love you guys for it!) But I was sceptical due to not being a big fan of your core series of ice creams. I had always found the core to be over powering, not allowing the rest of the ice cream to really shine, but this was totally different! This one some how is lighter, not to over bearing, and yet still brings the spoonful of chocolate to the table. Maybe its the oats, maybe its the amount of cocoa in the mix, who knows. But yall nailed it on the head this time! Really hope this stays, happy to have found something else chocolaty from you guys other then my usual Tonight Dough."
52_bj,MJamz,2019-03-21,5,Better than expected,8,1,"I went from psyched when I first saw these were out, to wary when I'd heard several pans of this flavor, to delighted when I decided to try it anyway (and wondering why I ever doubted myself)! I thought the base flavors were a little muted, yes, but the core and mix-ins were great--not too gargantuan fudge chips, soft and chewy cookies (not dry like some have experienced), and a really unique and fun core. Plus, my particular pint was quality-control goals--solid core all the way through the container, not a single air pocket, and plenty of mix-ins distributed from top to bottom too!"
52_bj,BrendaNoraG,2019-03-16,3,Kinda boring,13,4,Finallly found this flavor. Vanilla ice cream is good but plain. Peanut butter cookie dough pieces are smaller than I expected and have a bland/dry taste. Chocolate cookie core is mediocre at best. Not as full of topping as expected. I’m disappointed.
52_bj,Ks1986,2019-05-04,4,Do people not know what no bake cookies are?,18,3,"A lot of reviews you can tell these people have no idea what the core is supposed to be. It's not supposed to be like traditional cookie dough. It perfectly emulates the flavor and texture of classic no-bake cookies. A mixture primarily of chocolate, peanut butter, and oats dropped onto wax paper and cooled to form ""cookies"" that you don't need to bake."

52_bj,AshnPhilly,2019-04-25,2,Disappointed,1,1,"Just got a pint of this tonight, it looked so good in the store! But not so good at home. Mostly tastes like vanilla, very little peanut butter. Core part was good, but misaligned and had an air pocket so didn’t get as much as usual. Will be passing on this flavor in the future."
52_bj,Amanda8,2019-06-05,1,The core doesn’t taste at all like cookie dough,25,24,This flavor sounded so good but it was a let down for me. The vanilla ice cream was pretty bland and the chunks weren’t so good. Very small chocolate pieces and the peanut butter cookies tasted dry and also not very flavorful. Then the core just tasted like gritty sugar. It was really strange actually because normally I love all Ben & Jerry’s flavors. I don’t get why it was called cookie dough core because it was like a gritty paste with hard chunks (maybe oats?). I was expecting it to actually be the cookie dough that’s in their other ice creams. It almost seemed like all the sugar in the container went to the core because it was so sweet (yet still not good tasting) and the rest was so bland. This was a big miss. Maybe something went wrong with this batch because I can’t imagine they would want to produce this variety if they tasted it first. I’d recommend passing on this! one.
52_bj,Mdbenandjerry,2019-05-02,5,Shocked that anyone rates this less than 5 stars!,4,1,"Listen, the flavor combo = amazing. The peanut butter ice cream is rich and delicious and the vanilla balances it out. But the cookie core. The freaking. Cookie. Core. It is SO DELICIOUS.

52_bj,KCJane,2019-05-25,5,DELICIOUS!!!!!,3,1,"Where has this been all my life? No-bake cookies are possibly my favorite kind of cookie, so this core is TO DIE FOR. I saw another reviewer here didn't like it because they were expecting regular cookie dough -- I am concerned that they have never eaten a no-bake cookie before, which would be terribly sad if true. In any case, they're right: this cookie dough core is quite different from regular cookie dough. It's BETTER."

52_bj,ChrisColby,2020-02-23,3,Amazing Core,0,0,"The second best of the cookie dough core lineup, ""Wake and No Bake"" is tasty. The theme here is peanut butter and chocolate and the flavor delivers for the most part. The peanut butter ice cream goes perfectly with the fudge chips, so that works, but could've used more fudge chips. The vanilla ice cream tastes weak and only takes away from the peanut butter, while the peanut butter cookies taste a bit dry. What saves this flavor though is the ""No Bake"" core. It's absolutely delicious. The core tastes like a well balanced combination of chocolate and peanut butter while having a unique gritty/chunk texture. Some changes could've definitely improved this flavor but it's still a good chocolate/peanut butter mix overall."
52_bj,Madjars,2019-04-26,2,Ehh,0,0,The core is so small. But not as small as the supposedly pb cookie chunks. It tastes amazing otherwise !! More pb cookies & bigger core
52_bj,Kris10,2019-05-17,4,"5-star core, 4-star ice cream",2,0,"Core was great but a little disappointed in the actual ice cream flavors. The PB ice cream was underwhelming and hard to differentiate from the vanilla. Loved the peanut butter cookie chunks but could definitely use more fudge flakes, especially since the PB was so hard to taste."
52_bj,veganime,2019-06-13,3,Meh,1,0,"Eh, not my favorite. The core was very, very hard, and I had a difficult time breaking it up with my spoon. The peanut butter cookie dough wasn’t much better. It was dry and kind of flavorless - if you had me try one blindfolded, I wouldn’t be able to tell you what it was. I found myself picking out the core and peanut butter cookie dough pieces so that I could enjoy the vanilla and peanut butter ice creams, which were good. Not terrible, but won’t buy again."
52_bj,Freedom1330,2019-09-06,3,"I like it, but I don't.",0,0,"This is one of those ice creams where if you don't get a good pint of it, it's not very good. I agree with a lot of others on their reviews when they say the peanut butter side is bland, the vanilla side really comes through, the peanut butter cookie pieces are definitely dry and crumbly and not like a dough at all. And finally we get to the ever famous core. The core was a pretty big let down in multiple ways. First off, its always a different size in each pint. I also think it goes bad or gets almost freezer burnt tasting pretty quick even though the ice cream is not freezer burnt. It has a gritty, chocolatey and oat center. I definitely feel like more effort could be made to make this a better ice cream because the idea is amazing!!"
52_bj,Bgh123,2019-04-16,5,Best icecream ever,2,0,Seriously get this stuff!!!! My boyfriend and I ate the whole pint in one sitting
52_bj,LovePeanutButter,2019-07-20,3,Wake and No Bake - tasty but not what I expected.,0,0,"I bought some Wake and No Bake ice cream the other day at my local Walmart here in Texas. I ate half of it before I realized it was only Vanilla ice cream, peanut butter cookie dough pieces, and the chocolate cookie dough center. I think there was only a few Fudge chips and NO Peanut Butter ice cream. While it was delicious, as most Ben&Jerry's ice creams are, I was disappointed because I was in the mood for Peanut Butter Ice Cream with the fudge chips. Maybe a little quality control is needed for this product. Thanks."
52_bj,,2019-03-29,1,Seriously?!,2,2,"My husband and I are Ben & Jerry's HOUNDS. Anytime it's on sale or a new one comes out, we have to try it. So naturally, we were psyched to see that there were new flavors, and we bought all three. The Wake and ""No Bake"" had to be one if the grittiest and tasteless concoctions that has ever come from this brand. Honestly, it was terrible. The only ""flavor"" present was a weird burnt sugar after taste. Yikes."
52_bj,Votapkate,2019-03-17,1,Worst flavor,2,1,"I usually can’t put the spoon down when eating this ice cream, but it wasn’t hard to do with this flavor. The cookie dough bites seemed like they were flavorless, non-sugar pieces and the peanut butter cookie pieces were also pretty bland. The ice cream itself tasted okay, but I will definitely not eat this flavor again."
52_bj,ChrissyRo17,2019-06-05,1,Taste is very bland,1,0,"I purchased this today (6/3/19) at my local Kroger store. Usually, Ben and Jerry's can't be beat. However, this flavor is terrible. Very bland and the No-Bake cookie dough core is very gritty and stale tasting. I was very disappointed with this flavor pairing and would not recommend."
52_bj,Bumbed,2019-04-07,2,Hand packed-no thanks.,0,3,"I am psyched to live close to a B&J shop, especially when they have a limited pint, and a great selection of fresh hand packed. Wake and No Bake has to be good in a store pint, right? I hope, because I went with Wake and No Bake from hand packed, just seemed unusual. Super excited to finish dinner and pop the top. Well, it was just a blend of vanilla-ish and peanut-ish with some dry crumbs. Oh, what core? No idea, didn’t see or taste it. Hope stores bought is better. I’ll try it."
52_bj,Nats93,2019-09-22,1,Huge letdown,1,2,"Like others said, the description of the ice cream leads to a huge let down. As a fan of the peanut butter cup ice cream, I was excited to try this as it features peanut butter cookies and peanut butter ice cream. The peanut butter ice cream is undifferentiable from the vanilla ice cream, the cookie pieces are dry and tasteless, and the no bake cookie dough core is equally tastelss. I shan't stray from peanut butter cup again!"
52_bj,Rashelle,2019-04-14,5,Awesome core!,1,0,I've had this a few times now and my only complaint is that I wish there was more core!! It's so delicious!
52_bj,Ice Cream Monster,2019-05-31,5,Absolutely delicious - No bake cookie core,0,1,"I loved this ice cream. I've always been a fan of no bake cookies (for those not familiar with them, they're peanut butter, chocolate, oatmeal chunks that you eat. They're chewy and aren't like regular cookies or cookie dough), and the core was the best part! It was a little grittier than normal because of the temperature, but not enough to be off-putting. The peanut butter flavor in the ice cream was great also, and I'll be getting this again for sure!"
52_bj,juliaaaaaaa,2019-04-05,1,Ick,1,3,"This flavor is terrible. The peanut butter ice cream seemed essentially flavorless, there are very few fudge chips, the peanut butter cookie dough bites were hard and dry, and the core was borderline inedible. As another review said, the texture was like gritty sugar. I'm so confused about what this core is supposed to be. This is the very first Ben & Jerry's flavor I've ever less-than-loved."
52_bj,Weez,2019-03-22,2,Ehhhhh,1,1,Couldn’t wait for the new core flavors and so far all three are a disappointment! This flavor core is tasty but very grainy. The peanut butter icecream is pretty good. The vanilla is blah and the peanut butter cookie pieces have a faint taste. So far no core ice cream is better than the Peanut Buttah Cookie Core!!!
52_bj,Mike392,2019-10-06,5,A little core but still a lot of delight!!!!!!!!!!,0,1,Even though there was only a little core to the pint that I bought it was still very good! No regrets at all in fact I would eat two or three pints of wake and no bake cookie dough core ice cream. It was still extremely delicious and I’m still glad I bought it and I plan to buy it again as soon as I’m out and about at the grocery store. As a matter of fact I would recommend this to every one and this would have to be my absolute favorite.
52_bj,Hanita,2020-02-24,3,"Great Core, The Rest is Meh",0,1,"No-bake cookies are my absolute favorite cookies. They are like blobs of chocolate peanut butter oatmeal fudge. So for me, the core is basically crack. The ice cream is kinda boring, maybe a chocolate malt or banana would be better? The peanut butter cookies are DRY and totally ruined the whole thing. Why cookies in a 'no-bake' themed ice cream, obviously should be cookie dough. Just sayin'."
52_bj,jsven,2019-10-24,1,Core only went halfway down,0,3,"Bought it for 6 bucks and change at cub because everyone said it was good, it was way overpriced and the cookie dough core only went down half way. I could have gotten a cookies dough kemps gallon for cheaper and there would have been far more cookie dough. I had the love banana chocolate and grahm cracker one awhile back, that one was good, this one was huge disappointment."
52_bj,kika07,2019-04-05,1,DO NOT BUY!!!!,1,3,Me and my boyfriend love LOVE LOVE ben and jerry's. We usually have a pint every week. Our favorites are milk and cookies or boom chocolota core. BUT THIS ONE HERE.... not worth it. It was very very bland and we didn't understand the core? Worst then great value walmart ice cream.
52_bj,JRobertson,2019-04-08,2,Mehhh Disappointing,0,1,"This is the second of the three new 2019 core dough flavors that I’ve tried. Is it better than the chocolate chip cookie dough core one? Yes. But not by much. The peanut butter ice cream is good, the vanilla ice cream with the chips is boring. The pieces of peanut butter cookie are little and bland. Way too much ice cream to dough ratio. The core is...ok."
52_bj,Court25,2019-05-24,1,Not so great...,1,2,I was super excited when I saw this flavor and decided to give it a shot but I was not so impressed. The peanut butter cookie dough was very Minimal. After reading the reviews it seems like this ice cream is very inconsistent the peanut butter flavor in mine was incredibly delicious and you could taste it as soon as it hit your tongue. The vanilla was definitely a little bland but most vanilla is unless you purchase a French vanilla type ice cream. The core has a very off putting aftertaste I did see a review that this is what the core is supposed to look like taste like because that's what no bake cookies are and though I've never really had no bake cookie is I'm wondering if my pint taste different then that other persons pint because some of the reviews said they couldn't taste the peanut butter but I can taste the peanut butter spot on and some more saying that the core is delicious and for me it's not the texture of the core it's thing really badd aftertaste at leaves in your mouth that put me off I really hope this flavor goes through a remake because I think it could be really good.
52_bj,FuzzyGut,2019-03-21,3,50/50,0,1,"What a mixed bag these new pints are. This Wake and No Bake is not an exception. The core, like the other is rock hard but at least it tastes good. The ice cream, both side of it, is not bad, not good, just kind of mediocre. The mix ins were few in my pint. Kind of let down. I won’t be buying this one again."
52_bj,Zenka16,2019-04-23,1,Core Was Unusual,0,2,"I love Ben and Jerry’s ice cream, but this core flavor was disappointing. The ice cream and cookie bits were fine, but I don’t know what was going on with the core! It was grainy and hard to chew and tasted nothing like cookie dough. I would get any other flavor before picking this one up. Super disappointed."
52_bj,LaurenLauren,2019-03-30,2,Very bland,0,1,"The no-bake cookie dough core was alright, the ice cream itself was really, really bland and boring. The dough pieces throughout had almost no flavor and I could hardly tell the difference between the two different sides. Unfortunately wouldn’t ever buy again, even if it was on clearance for $1"
52_bj,Not a Fan,2019-08-16,1,Dissappointing,0,0,"I love trying new flavors and the Wake and No Bake sounded like an exciting new flavor to try. It was a total let down. The ""core"" was gritty and I wouldn't consider it a core since it was only at the top of the pint. I also didn't taste peanut butter ice cream and didn't see any fudge chips."
52_bj,Larss,2019-05-04,1,Gross core,0,2,"I enjoyed the ice cream part of this but the core was disgusting. It says it's a cookie dough core and I figured ""wow that sounds good"" but then when I tried it the core is this awful dry nougaty chocolate and was not at all like how it is labeled. I will never again buy this flavor."
52_bj,Mikel116,2019-05-30,1,Cookie Dough Bore,1,4,"I lost a lot of weight after having my daughter and gained it back by eating a pint of B&J everyday for a YEAR. I may not be a food scientists or sensory analysts but I do consider myself a bit of an expert when it comes to B&J. I know what no-bake cookies are so I didn't expect this to remind me of regular cookie dough. That being said, this was the most disappointing pint I've had and I am pretty sure I have tried every flavor available within 15 miles. Even the plain vanilla seems to have more flavor than the vanilla half of this pint. B&J is known for their generosity when it comes chunks, but there were 6-8 PB cookie dough balls in the entire pint. The peanut butter half was supposed to have chocolate chunks but there was literally not a single chocolate chunk in the entire pint. And the cookie core didn't really have flavor. It was hard and gritty with just a hint of chocolate flavor- not at all what I would expect from the geniuses who brought us miracles like Phish Food and Cinnabuns and Seven Layer Bar. I would highly recommend that you skip this pint and try another flavor... ANY OTHER FLAVOR."

53_bj,Alyssa26,2019-03-23,2,Frustrated,3,1,"I love this flavor and buy it frequently. However, in the last six months a few of my pints have been “dried out”. The brownie pieces completely crumble and the batter center is as hard as a rock. I know this isn’t how it’s suppsed to be because when it’s right its amazing and my favorite flavor. I’m attaching pictures of the dried out pieces."
53_bj,Rubberduckie,2019-07-29,2,"Brownie flavor on point, just missed it",10,1,"Brownie batter is like a chocolate lovers dream. Unfortunately with the core series it's a hit or miss, even if you find a suitable flavor you still play chance with even having one. This was essentially just chocolate and vanilla ice cream. I found the core after a couple spoon fulls and it was heaven. I had a feeling it'd be short lived and I was right the core disappeared before I made it to the bottom. Didn't even mind the missing brownie, just add more core !"
53_bj,AtomicHoney,2017-08-13,2,Just doesn't do it for me,5,1,"I got this flavor instead of my usual core flavor and was disappointed. Its not that its bad so to speak, it was just...not good. I had to force myself to eat this flavor just to not let the food go to waste. Usually Ben and Jerry use pretty good ingredients, but this time, something in the core just didn't settle taste wise with me. It tasted almost artificial. Not like brownie batter at all. I probably would have been happier with plain old chocolate or vanilla ice cream on their own. The core ruined it for me. Not to mention that there wasn't very much of it, which turned out in my favor because once the core was gone, the ice cream was slightly more enjoyable."
53_bj,Maryi56,2020-05-20,3,Where did the core go,5,0,The first few spoon fulls were amazing.. but as soon as I hit the middle section the core disappeared. The core disappearing half way through was disappointing since I was expecting the core to be consistent all the way to the bottom. Such amazing tasting ice cream just wish the core continued throughout the whole pint.
53_bj,KristaRN,2019-02-20,5,Brownie Points,1,0,"Let’s say you were baking brownies and decided to lick the bowl. However, now you add in chocolate and vanilla ice cream to the mix. Sounds amazing right? Well it doesn’t stop there, now you throw in pieces of brownie to top it all off. It was like perfection in ice cream form. I think this came straight from the kitchen of the big man himself. I just sent my husband back to the grocery store because he forgot to pick up my icecream or I threatened to unrelentlessly nag him for the next hour. That’s how good it is. My core went from top to bottom like icecream intestines so I’m not sure about previous faults, but the issue appears to be solved here in SC. Good work on this one!"
53_bj,Alynicole18,2017-06-29,2,Not very much core,4,2,I bought this item but less than halfway through the pint the core disappeared I'm disappointed because it was so good
53_bj,FuzzyGut,2019-03-09,4,Almost 100% perfect,12,2,"Everything here worked for me, and I’ve never had a core pint that didn’t go all the way down to the bottom. The brownie and ice cream flavor and texture are perfect. My only issue is that the core itself tastes more like thick fudge than brownie. Delicious for sure but I was hoping for more a brownie batter than fudge flavor, as the pint labeling suggests."
53_bj,halcyon,2018-02-03,3,Okay,1,1,"My pint has about 3/4 chocolate and 1/4 vanilla. Which is just as well, as the vanilla has no flavor and seems more like ice milk. I tried a bite by itself because I've read that B&J makes one of the best vanilla ice creams. Now I'm wondering if this is the same as the vanilla pints, or perhaps a lesser quality is used here, since there's a lot of other stuff going on to mask it. My first thought upon trying the chocolate side was ""coconut oil."" That's always disappointing as it's a rather prominent flavor. The core is good and gooey with a taste more of syrup than batter. I tried this as the store was out of the one I wanted. In the future I'll stick to the really good ones."
53_bj,larsen2398,2019-04-19,1,This makes me sad.,1,0,"I just bought this flavor while at Walmart the other day as a treat for the stressful week before finals. I usually get the cheapest ice cream at Walmart but figured I could splurge. I love brownie batter but found that the ""brownie batter core"" tasted nothing like brownie batter. Instead, the core was just like a chocolate fudge syrup. The description also states there would be half vanilla and half chocolate ice cream with brownie chunks surrounding the core. More than 3/4 of the ice cream in my container was chocolate. Sorry Ben & Jerry's, definitely not as good as expected."

53_bj,WP ice cream lover,2018-03-30,1,Disappointed,1,0,"Brownie Batter was my favorite flavor maybe 15 years ago. It's was heaven on a spoon. Then it disappeared and i was lost.
When I saw this one, I was super excited that it might be close to heaven as I knew it. The brownie pieces are yummy, but the gooey batter ""core"" almost ruins this pint. It's not brownie batter at all, it's a very sweet and almost artificial chocolate syrup that would be better left out. I wish i could use more delicious words to describe this flavor, but I can't lie, it's a disappointment, sorry guys!"
53_bj,Robyn92,2019-01-07,3,Mostly just chocolate and vanilla ice cream,0,0,"It had been awhile since I had given in to my B&J's craving. I saw this flavor and was curious about the core. The first 1/3 of the pint was good, but not even halfway through the core disappeared and I was left with basically vanilla and chocolate ice cream. It was also definitely lacking in brownie pieces. A little disappointed."
53_bj,cheyenne12_25,2017-07-04,2,SO good but short lived,3,1,"The first several bites were really good (despite there not being any brownie pieces in the first 1/4 of the pint). The brownie batter was really good and it was overflowing but then about half way thru the pint, the brownie batter stopped. And then nothing. From then on it was just chocolate and vanilla ice cream with an occasional brownie piece. This could be a really great flavor if it was made correctly."

This stuff is so perfectly decadent that I almost couldn’t finish a pint of it, which is definitely an accomplishment in my book and I’m the book of anyone who’s witnessed me inhale a whole pint of green tea ice cream on a regular day."
53_bj,emely,2017-07-28,3,Has good potential,2,0,I was slightly disappointed but there are good flavors. I wish it had more whole brownies and the core should go down to the bottom of the pint. Has lots of potential if tweaked.

53_bj,Matthew6767,2017-10-22,2,Disappointed Sadly,0,0,"I decided to get this core flavor (my publix was all out of my favorite flavors) and I had never had any of the core ice creams before. I was disappointed to say the least, the core was non existent and seemed to go missing towards the middle, and the brownie bits when I found them were absolutely dreadful. Overall I was very disappointed and had to throw it away after being grossed out by the core and brownie flavors. Please do something about these two, the ice cream itself was on point, but the brownie bits and batter need a flavor overhaul."
53_bj,Kadi,2017-09-21,5,I found the core!!,0,0,"The first time I bought this flavor I was so hopeful, because brownie batter is my favorite b&J's flavor of all time, but I got my pint home and there was hardly any core in it (as the other reviews have mentioned). For that reason I hadn't repurchased until last week when I was desperate bc nothing else at the store sounded good, and lo and behold there was core all the way through!!! So much core in fact, that I questioned if I'd run out of ice cream before core!! (It was close, but I worked diligently to conquer a perfectly balanced core to ice cream ratio from start to finish. Still doesn't compare to the original brownie batter, but I'm so glad you all resolved this coreless issue so many had encountered. Reviewers, your voice was heard!"

The Brownie Batter Core has great potential, however the taste of the “brownie batter” is not great. I honestly don’t even know what to compare it to. The core was also gone mid-way through the ice cream as if they pour it all on top then forgot about the rest of the pint. There also were many brownie bits, it was essentially a pint of chocolate and vanilla ice cream swirled together and that was it. Quite disappointing."

Hopefully, the core will be all the way through next time."

The chocolate and vanilla combination was good with the brownie pieces, but I wouldn't call it brownie. I think the factory should work on this flavor more and make it brownie, not chocolate fudge flavor, or just rename it."
53_bj,Lei12,2017-07-16,3,Would be excellent... if only there was more core!,1,0,"Like some other reviewers, the core in this carton was sparse. What I did manage to get was soo delicious and chocolately, however halfway through the carton, the core was missing! Please think about adding more core to this ice cream, it is the best part"
53_bj,Laur,2018-01-08,5,My Fave Ice Cream,0,0,"I found this by accident as one day I couldnt find my second fave ""Milk and Cookies"". I love that there's a great flavor that combines vanilla and chocolate ice cream without nuts, but with some brownie pieces. Legitimately, this is my favorite ice cream across all brands, and now I don't even buy other brands, since I've fallen for this flavor. They no longer carry this flavor at my neighborhood store, so I'm forced to buy it at Target...which is ok with me :-)"
53_bj,Zinxo,2017-08-10,5,Best flavour I have ever tried.,1,0,It's more of a dessert than an ice cream. Really full and rich.
53_bj,kzawideh,2017-11-27,2,"Good idea, unfortunate execution",0,0,"I bought this ice cream expecting a mix of chocolate and vanilla ice cream with brownie bits and a brownie batter core, unfortunately upon opening the container the brownie batter core was right at the top and make a mess, also the texture of the brownie batter was more like runny chocolate sauce than brownie batter, which was the biggest disappointment for me, also there were not many brownie chunks throughtout the vanilla and chocolate ice cream."
53_bj,,2017-11-12,5,LOVE IT!,0,0,"I am a hardcore chocolate brownie (anything brownie) ice cream fan. This... this is my fave Ben & Jerry's so far. I haven't had any problems with the core not hitting the bottom. I think the vanilla ice cream adds a nice balance to the overall chocolatey-ness (is that a word?) Anywho, Ben & Jerry's, a sincere thank you from the bottom of this girl's brownie lovin' heart."
53_bj,mary27,2018-07-28,3,"Great ice cream, okay core",0,0,"This was my first time purchasing this flavor and although the ice cream itself was really good, the core flavor was a bit disappointing compared to the other core flavors I normally get. The brownie batter core didn't go all the way to the bottom, and it was very bitter and tasted like artificial fudge. The core itself was the only thing wrong with the ice cream, everything else tasted amazing. I love the brownie and vanilla ice cream."
53_bj,PrincessDemandyPants,2017-11-25,1,To the graveyard!,0,0,"Oh no! There can be too much of a good thing and this flavor proves it. Chocolate Therapy manages to be ooey-gooey and over the top chocolate mayhem without being intensely sweet. The same cannot be said for its chocolate cored partner-in-crime, brownie chunked friend. If you can figure out a way to temper the evil Dr. Sugar, you may have a winner. If not, consign it to the graveyard to spare humanity."
53_bj,Blue who,2019-01-13,5,Amazing,0,0,"Let me start by saying I'm a die hard blue bell lover.
But this ice cream is my new number one, it is always perfect from top to bottom. If there was a way to get it without the brownie piece's that would be hands down the best! The flavors of the chocolate and vanilla mixed with the brownie core are perfection! The only thing to make it better would be if it came in a bigger container."
53_bj,Champion for the helpless,2020-08-25,1,My favorite ice cream on earth BUT!,0,0,I eat this flavor at least 4 times a week but I'm getting tired of the core missing or very little. I have read reviews going back 2017. Clearly this is something being done for cost reasons. Easy adjustment at the factory to fix this problem or replace the person in charge. The chocolate cookie core ice cream also has a very small core. I'm going to find a new gourmet brand of ice cream.
53_bj,Kcbella64,2020-07-02,4,Favorite Flavor,0,0,"Didn't realize that icecream this good existed, unfortunately there was an air bubble at the bottom that robbed me of a fair chance at happiness. I'd also like to add that this has one of the lowest ratings on here yet when I went back to the store to get more, it was all sold out. So if yall are giving low rating to keep ppl away I fear its too late."
53_bj,Cassi7321,2019-09-03,5,Cheat Day Favorite,0,0,This is definitely among my go-to Ben&Jerry’s flavors. The gooey chocolately brownie batter is perfect to really treat yourself after a long week. And I love that the actual icecream isnt overly sweet so that once the batter gets to be too much I can give my taste buds a refreshing break. Seriously its so decadent and I always have a craving for this
53_bj,Kenzie,2020-01-17,3,Great!.. Until you get to the bottom,0,0,"This one is by far my favorite, but it has a terrible draw back! The Core is supposed to be the best part, don't get me wrong it is, but it is a small part that should be alot more than just a bite. At the bottom its just chocolate and vanilla ice cream. I just wish the browies and core were all throughout the pint like it is advertised."
53_bj,Faeli,2017-10-11,1,Freezer burner beyond recognition!,0,1,I am SO DISAPPOINTED. I'm sick and sent my bf to the store for ice cream and got the brownie core... it's so freezer burned I don't even want to bother with it! I've never had the brownie core so this is really disappointing. Not to mention it mentions fudge brownies in it and I have not found a single one. I'm giving up on it.
53_bj,Jb1777,2018-09-01,3,"Very Tasty, core lets it down.",0,0,"I buy this regularly as it is my favourite flavour. However, on multiple occasions of me buying this the core has been pretty disappointing. I find that the never really seems to go down to the bottom or even halfway. It’s more like a fat blob at the top and nothing more. Overall, it tastes very nice but the core lets it down."
53_bj,JJ419,2019-04-15,1,Kind of Disappointing,0,0,I kept hearing so much great things about Ben & Jerry's ice cream flavors. This is the first one I ever tried and it was disappointing. I was really looking forward to have brownie pieces but I think I found like 2. The rest were like crumbs. The core was barely there too. I'll try another one but this wasn't worth it to me.
53_bj,Mirevas,2020-08-31,3,Love the flavors but they’re so inconsistent,0,0,"I’m new to Ben n Jerry’s and so far have gotten 2 brown batter cores and 1 chocolate fudge brownie. I absolutely love the flavors but the cores for both didn’t go all the way down and for the fudge brownie, there weren’t any fudge brownie pieces until I reached the halfway point so it was kind of disappointing"
53_bj,Tbreanne,2017-08-11,4,MORE CORE!,0,0,"This is the best ice cream flavor, and the core is the best part. But halfway through the core just stopped, and it's very disappointing since getting the gooey core in every bite is what makes this ice cream the best ice cream there is! Seriously just needs the core all the way through!"
53_bj,Haileeey,2020-03-09,5,100% my favourite flavour,0,0,This is hands down my favourite flavour. The only way it could be improved is by replacing the vanilla ice cream with more chocolate haha! BUT the Australian Ben and Jerry's has stopped selling it here so now it exists only in my dreams..... No other flavour matches up in my opinion
53_bj,jakevett9,2018-05-12,5,AMAZINGGGGGGGGG,0,0,"I just had this flavor last night! The core was so thick and gooey just like brownie batter! My core ran all the way to the bottom. I had lots of brownie chunks in mine and they were delicious and chewy!!!! Best ice cream I have ever had. If you're a brownie lover, eat this."
53_bj,JamieG2020,2018-07-08,2,Where is the core?,0,0,Fudge Brownie is my absolute favorite flavor as well as the boom chocalata cookie core one so I decided this flavor would be the holy grail!! But only 1/3 of the pint had the core part opposed to the other flavors that I’ve tried having core in the whole pint! Why is this?
53_bj,Stevi,2017-08-02,3,Love the core till it was gone,0,0,I love several flavors of Ben and jerrys ice cream I just recently tried this flavor and fell in love but all 3 pints I have eaten i too have missed the core not even half way through. It ls amazing but not near as amazing without the core!!! Definitely needs more!!!
53_bj,PapaSmurf,2017-11-26,3,Good but not great,0,0,"It’s hard to ever give a bad review on Ben and Jerry’s ice cream, but I am going to try. As far as brownie goes, I only got little hints, but the core was great. The brownie flavor was good, just not enough of it. As always, the ice cream was still very enjoyable."
53_bj,lilianna,2018-02-25,5,Amazing!!,0,0,I love this ice cream!! I have actually never had a problem with the core because whenever I buy these the core goes all the way to the bottom. Anyway if you like chocolate and vanilla and brownies separately you’re gonna LOVE them all together with this flavor!
53_bj,c_pro,2019-12-03,2,Gimme more core (and brownies)!,0,0,"Man, I wanted to love this but I was completely disappointed by the core which did not go all the way to the bottom (not to mention the lack of brownie pieces). Ugh, Ben and Jerry’s, please fix ASAP as this pint has the potential to knock it out of the park!"
53_bj,tmarie14,2019-05-03,5,NEW FAVORITE FLAVOR,0,0,The first and only time i’ve had it i absolutely loved it. Im impatiently waiting for my local publix to restock it i might try my local walmart to see if they have it though. i ate it on it for 2 days and i couldnt get enough of it. it’s my new favorite!!!
53_bj,maggiep,2017-09-06,4,"Great Flavor, not enough core!",0,0,"I love this flavor, but I've gotten it twice and both times the core has disappeared about halfway through the pint. I haven't had this issue with other core flavors, so it seems to be unique to this flavor. It would be perfect if it reached the bottom!"
53_bj,liyah21,2019-09-09,1,Upset customer,0,0,I buy brownie batter core about 3-4 times a week and for about the past month every batch has dried out brownies and it’s literally disgusting. Haven’t had a good batch in a month! And i hate chocolate and this actually made me like chocolate.
53_bj,Elaine B,2018-02-19,3,I can't get rid of all these muffin stubs!,0,0,This is a great ice cream. The only negative is the brownie batter core only goes 3/4s the way down. Leaving the 1/4 usually going the dog. Still well worth the purchase. Thank you guys for making the best ice cream in the world.
53_bj,Karen,2017-11-18,5,Best Flavor Ever,0,0,"The year 2017 has been all about Brownie Batter when l find it on Sale l buy all the store has twice. Unfortunately, l have to have one every night and my weight shows it. So, l decided to give up food so l could have my ice cream."
53_bj,Iceeeeeeekreamm,2019-05-30,1,Bland,0,0,Tried this out hoping for a little bit of a variety in the chocolate and vanilla taste. All I got was a bland chocolate with not much else. If the texture and chocolate flavor itself had even a slight variation it would be ok.
53_bj,mpg1904,2018-08-01,3,Not enough core,0,0,"I decided to try a new flavor and while the flavor was delicious, the core did not go to the bottom of the container. It ended about 2/3 of the way down which was disappointing because that was the best part of the ice cream."
53_bj,Sydsm,2018-12-05,1,DISGUSTING,0,1,Please tell me why the brownie core is probably the worst taking brownie batter possible? First of all the viscosity is wayyyy off! No brownie batter is that this/ taste like the fakest chocolate on earth. Never getting again
53_bj,Jake3469,2019-10-18,5,So good,0,0,"I don’t know why this one is rated around only 3 1/2 - 4 stars, it is honestly so good! It’s basically a hot fudge sundae mixed with brownies. Honestly one of their best flavors, I absolutely love it, and recommend highly"
53_bj,PhoenixRises,2019-09-03,5,Love the Brownies & the Brownie Batter Core!,0,0,This is probably my second favorite out of the Cores. I love brownies and I love Brownie batter so this was a win for me! The vanilla balances it all out so it won't be too much chocolate. I hope they keep this flavor.
53_bj,Eleah911,2020-03-14,5,❤❤,0,0,"This is my fave flavor. The core tastes more like fudge than brownie batter, but I love it! Sometimes the core doesn't always go all the way to the bottom though, wish it would! Aside from that, I could live off it."
53_bj,Mads,2018-07-22,2,Bring back the brownie batter swirl,0,0,"I bought this one after not seeing the brownie batter flavor out anymore, which was clearly made with real brownie batter. This tastes more like and has the texture of a brownie that went soggy then got froze :("
53_bj,Dejota,2017-08-23,4,pretty good,0,0,Pretty good ice cream but overall could be better executed. I love most of the core ice cream lines even though each series seems to be a re-run of previous series. Still a good product and will buy in a pinch.
53_bj,MegS,2018-08-28,2,Great potential!,0,0,"I loved loved the bites that had some of the core or brownie bits. Sadly, those bites were limited. The core was short lived and I maybe found 2 brownie bites. It was more just vanilla and chocolate ice cream."
53_bj,Banana1128,2019-09-25,2,No core,0,0,This is the second pint that I’ve bought and both times there was no brownie batter core. Just small amounts here and there. The ice cream was still good but I was looking forward to the brownie batter core!
53_bj,dcol,2018-02-02,5,Don't Ever Leave Me Again!,0,0,I love this ice cream and am so thankful you brought it back from the B&J graveyard. I know it's a little different blend the original Brownie Batter but the flavor is just as good. Don't ever go away again!
53_bj,Mikayla2242,2019-03-03,3,Good concept,0,0,"I agree with several of the other reviews. The flavor was great, but really disappointed in the lack of the core that was in my container!! It was very thin and ran out half way through the container."
53_bj,IzzyBella,2017-12-07,1,Sad,0,0,I knew I was taking a chance on this bc of the mixed reviews. The core only went 1/3 of the way thru and the brownie chunks were too hard. I love Ben & Jerry's but I'm disappointed with this one.
53_bj,AshK,2019-08-17,1,few brownies and no core!!!,0,0,Was very excited to try this flavor since I love chewy bits in my ice cream but there were very few brownies bits and the core was barely in there. Disappointed because I wanted to love it:(
53_bj,Valy,2019-04-16,5,Perfect!,0,0,"I have never found a combination as amazing as this one. It's got everything I want. Chocolate, vanilla, brownie chunks and a fantastic brownie batter to amplify its flavour. I love it!"
53_bj,sydney13,2019-05-27,5,My favorite core flavor!,0,0,"I have tried several of the core flavors and this is my favorite by far! It is a chocolate lovers dream. The brownie batter core is so decadent, and I love the brownie chunks!"
53_bj,Tsd8,2018-04-10,2,Still no core,0,0,Great ice cream flavors but the core ratio is horrible its more Like a topping. The same for the karamel sutra core is gone before you even get to the middle of the pint
53_bj,Jason04,2019-04-22,3,"Really good, but...",0,0,"Great ice cream, as usual from Ben & Jerry's, but the core was only in the top third of the pint. Too bad, it really made this flavor work. Just not enough of it."

53_bj,Jadaboo,2019-07-17,4,Yummmmmm,0,0,I bought 2 pints at once. First pint was perfect. The second had maybe 4 pieces of brownie in it. (Which is the best part for me) I was highly disappointed!
53_bj,Milo,2018-08-13,5,Best flavor for a chocolate lover,0,0,I love chocolate. Especially dark chocolate. If you love chocolate as well - get this ice cream. The vanilla mixed in is the perfect amount.
53_bj,Rachlen34,2018-02-11,3,"Great flavor, but poor core!",0,0,"LOVE THIS FLAVOR!!! But the core doesn’t reach past the top third, you miss brownie batter towards the end of the pint. Bit of a bummer :("

It's super expensive there but I HAD to have it. I've never been so happy in my whole life. I want this ice cream everywhere in my life from now on.
54_bj,,2018-02-17,5,"So good, I'm going to start going to church again.",23,1,"If Jesus made ice cream, and not, like, carpenter-y things, he would make this. If God made this ice cream, I promise he wouldn't have bothered with the rest of creation. He'd just sit on his God couch and get wicked fat eating this all the time, except there wouldn't be time, because you know... no creation needed after the crowning achievement of the cheesecake core. Yup."

Just a typical mom having a bad day, well late that night went in the fridge, and wanted to try the ice cream I got, never have I tried it before, can I say I couldn't put this down. This made me in such a happy mood, I can't stop telling my husband and everyone else about this delicious ice cream, it was so good that I went and got another. I hope I don't get too big, that's my worry now! Try this flavor ONLY
if you like cheesecake and cookies and cream ice cream, I promise you, you will love it. Thanx again for making this one. Great job! P.s. I'm super picky!"

Per the graphic on top of the pint lid, the cookies are supposed to be distributed throughout the whole pint. To my surprise, while I was eating this ice cream their were ZERO cookies on the cheesecake side and only a few on the chocolate side. As a seasoned Ben and Jerry’s eater, I was highly disappointed."
54_bj,FuzzyGut,2018-07-02,2,Sorry,5,3,"Like most other reviewers, I am a huge Ben and Jerry’s fan and will be through good and not so good pints. I really didn’t like this one. The ice cream was grainy on both sides and the cheesecake ice cream was not so tasty and I ate around it. The chocolate side was good, albeit not smooth. The cheesecake core tasted great but it was very hard and there was very little of it. I ended up throwing half the pint away. Oh well, onto another new Ben and Jerry’s flavor to try."
54_bj,bigsteveokay,2017-08-11,5,This is the best flavor I've found so far,4,0,This is the best flavor of B&Js I've found so far. I can't do nuts or bananas and this one is excellent and won't kill me!

54_bj,The Jellyman,2017-11-22,5,Awesome core!,2,0,I got this at Walmart and it was epic! The chocolate ice cream is sweet and the cheesecake ice cream tastes similar to vanilla. The chocolate cookies add a really good crunch and texture to the creamy ice cream. The core was the bomb though. It tastes exactly like actual cheesecake and is rich and dense. I 100% APPROVE THIS FLAVOR TO ANYONE AND EVERYONE.
54_bj,Spayne201,2017-08-15,2,I liked the chocolate and cookie part...,2,0,I was so excited to find this flavor! I was then disappointed by a very artificially tasting attempt at cheesecake for the ice cream and the core tasted more like thick baking glaze with too much confectioners sugar. Very disappointing. The chocolate ice cream and the cookie pieces were yummy though.
54_bj,Dejota,2017-11-10,2,Good ice cream but not the flavor inside,11,14,I was excited to buy this when I saw it. I love cheesecake! I love cookies and cream! Great combo especially in a core Ben and jerry's. I was sorely disappointed. Don't get me wrong. The ice cream was good but... it was literally cookies and cream ice cream with a vanilla core. Vanilla. Core. That was it. No cream cheese. No cream cheese core. Nothing. Just vanilla ice cream. Very very disappointing.

I love cheesecake and in my old age I am loving chocolate ice cream and cookies more and more. Well you get all of this in one pint. Real cheesecake. I meant to take one bite to just taste it and oops, just like that it was gone. I had to go buy more."

54_bj,Austin98,2017-11-11,1,Really?,2,9,"I'm the type of person to never write a review, especially when it's for some ice cream... As i put the first spoon in my mouth i waited for the great taste of Ben & Jerry's but instead got the weakest flavor i think i've ever tasted. If this was repackaged and sold as a single spoon of nesquik in a gallon of water flavour i might have actually thought twice about paying for this super overpriced rubbish. It's not like i went into it wanting it to be bad. I'm the least fussy eater i know, and i don't think i've ever disliked Ben & Jerry's, or ice cream in general. It's not that the flavour is bad it's just so weak. The bargain supermarket brand chocolate ice cream tasted more like chocolate than this. Also the core tastes about as much like cheese cake as Gatorade tastes like almond milk... Guess what it doesn't. This ice cream is great if you find mayonnaise spicy. 0/10."
54_bj,queen23,2018-07-15,1,disappointed,1,1,"I bought this and my core didn’t even start at the top. Then when it did appear it was only about 1 inch down and then dissapeared.

55_bj,Cookie123,2018-04-12,3,Not a core just a small plug,4,0,I've read all the reviews and they are correct the core does not go all the way through this product it is more like a caramel plug. Was disappointed
55_bj,Cows,2017-10-20,5,My Reason for Living,17,0,I love this so much that I’ve honestly considered moving to VT to work in the factory so I can be so close to the creation of pure goodness. The only possible way to improve this would be to invent a time machine that comes with it so you can always go back and taste it for the first time and see the moment your life changes.
55_bj,Brandi,2018-10-16,3,"So delicious, but...",12,0,"I bought this from Publix a few days ago and I loved it, until I noticed the core stopped half way through. It was very disappointing, the caramel core was my favorite part :("

55_bj,Cait5,2018-11-11,3,"Good flavor, but not enough caramel",1,0,"The caramel flavored ice cream is ok--it would be better as vanilla. But the combination of the chocolate flavor, the chocolate chunks, and the soft caramel core is delightful!! The only problem is that the caramel core *always* stops halfway through the pint, rendering the other half of the pint completely and totally worthless. The last pint I got, my boyfriend grabbed one small bowl of it, and there was no caramel left at all after that--there should be way more caramel since this flavor can really only be enjoyed by one person, one time before the rest of the pint is ready to be tossed. Again, good flavor, but poor execution. I would highly recommend it if there were more than a dollop of caramel."
55_bj,lottybee91,2017-06-13,3,Disappointing,5,0,I used to love this but the last few times ive bought a tub the core stops halfway down! :-( so disappointing as the core is the best bit. The bottom half of the tub is boring! Wont be buying it anymore.
55_bj,Kjeffersk,2020-07-01,3,My favorite flavor but,0,0,This is my favorite flavor. I love the Caramel ice cream with the caramel core and the chocolate ice cream with the chocolate chunks. But the last two times I have bought this the chocolate chunks have been in the caramel ice and not the chocolate ice cream. So you can’t the caramel ice cream flavor and I’ve have very disappointed. I hope this isn’t the new normal and it’s just a quality control issue.
55_bj,Carolina,2017-12-14,2,Disappointed,1,0,"Bought this for the first time expecting the core to go all the way down. It didn’t, it stopped about 1/4 of the way in. So I did research and i found it was meant to go all the down so again I bought it along with a friend who also bought the same and to our disappointment the core AGAIN stopped 1/4 of the way in. I only purchased it for the caramel centre therefore will not be buying again as I do not want just chocololate ice cream. As the was 2/3 chocolate ice cream 1/3 caramel ice cream."

55_bj,Melask,2018-05-16,3,The core issue,1,0,"Obviosly when you read all reviews it becomes clear that it is not your intentions to have the core go all the way to the bottom. Considering how much they cost, that is really not okay. Other than that (which is quite major though), the icecream is good but the chocolate ice cream lacks a lot of taste and is quite hard and not at all as creamy as the caramel one. It could be amazing, but you have a lot to fix."
55_bj,Jenna321,2020-07-03,5,"No caramel in ""karamel sutra""??",0,0,"I've frequently purchased the karamel sutra core iced cream from ben and jerry's, so when i bought one to find there was absolutely no caramel, as in not even a single drop of caramel in the pint, i was highly disappointed. I've seen alot of other comments from people having similar experiences with karamel sutra ranging from only 1/2 the amount of caramel the pint should have all the way to what i experienced which was absolutely no caramel. Ben and Jerry's definitely makes some good iced cream, but they need some serious quality control."
55_bj,MsLizzy,2017-08-31,3,Love Karamel,1,0,"Being gluten free it's difficult to find great flavors in ice cream. I was disappointed that the caramel didn't go to the bottom, the whole reason I purchased the ice cream.
I would like to continue buying the GF flavors and really hope you can add the caramel to the entire pint!
Maybe some coupons will inspire me to try this flavor again!"
55_bj,Ana123,2018-05-11,3,"Super tasty, but no caramel!",1,0,"I bought a pint a few days ago and was super excited to try a new flavor! The ice-cream itself was delicious as always, but there was only a tiny bit of caramel at the top of the pint. The ""core"" aspect of this ice-cream was nonexistent. I think this was just a fluke, but for 5 bucks, it was disappointing."
55_bj,MandyHope,2018-04-16,2,"No caramel, great ice cream",1,0,"Yesterday we just bought a pint of this from an Earth Fare grocery. It is well within date, and the chocolate and vanilla ice creams inside were nice. BUT the supposed ""core"" of caramel was no more than a tablespoon-sized dollop at the top. No more caramel in the whole pint if ""karamel"" sutra ice cream."

55_bj,rose,2017-06-05,3,disappointed about the core,1,0,The core does not go all the way through and is truly disappointing because that's why I buy this! It stops about a third of the way through. Second time in a row recently this has happened.
55_bj,ajoshua,2018-05-16,3,So yum but..,1,0,"First, I love Ben and Jerrys. And I love all these flavors, the core is great. But it ended like a quarter of the way into the pint, which was disappointing cause it was the best part."
55_bj,Ruthgrace,2017-08-08,2,Disappointing,1,0,"Brought this last night, flavour is amazing, just a shame that the core only goes down half way. Considering they cost $13 each here in Australia, not happy."
55_bj,LucyS,2017-10-06,3,Love half of it,1,0,The caramel ice cream half is amazing but the chocolate doesn't have enough flavour and the caramel core stops halfway. Salted caramel core is way better.

This ice cream is perfect for those that only stick to one kind of thing, but want to venture out and try something new. Karamel Sutra, is that new exciting flavor that has familiar vibes.

55_bj,Ben Cross,2018-06-16,5,Pint Sized Perfection!,0,0,"Karamel Sutra is an incredible blend of creamy, rich flavored ice cream with fudge chunks and mouth watering caramel core. It possesses the power to crush a person’s attempt to diet while making them perfectly happy to do so! While it is fair to say on occasion the caramel core does not reach the bottom of the pint, it won’t stop you from savoring every last bite! Go out and get this ice cream today before I eat it all."

I have honestly had a disgusting amount of this flavor since my discovery. I know sometimes the core doesn't go all the way down, but I just eat a little off the top, then scoop out the rest in one giant scoop and flip it upside down. Then the core can be saved for last!!"
55_bj,Siren,2019-01-25,4,Good idea...,0,0,I love this flavor! Who doesn't want a thick gooey glob of caramel in the middle of their ice cream?! Only problem is about have way through the container the core is no longer there. The first time I thought maybe I just got a bad batch. It happens. Although I'm currently eating my third on (over a few months period of time I promise) and here I'am in the middle of the pint with no more core
55_bj,FuzzyGut,2019-02-09,5,How I love thee,0,0,"This stuff... this stuff here. The caramel ice cream does taste like caramel. Rich and creamy like all Ben and Jerry’s. The chocolate side with fudge flakes is my favorite half. But the best part is that thick, sweet caramel core! It’s perfect caramel, flowing like honey through the ice cream, daring me to eat the core out of it and leave the ice cream for seconds. This is GREAT ice cream!!"
55_bj,Bream,2017-12-01,5,WHERE DID IT GO?,0,0,"This is the only flavor I've ever been able to find that's gluten free so it's been my go-to for several years... then out of nowhere it has disappeared from the 3 places I have been buying it from. A couple of months ago our Kroger stopped carrying it and then our small local grocery store ran out a few weeks later and last week I went to Whole Foods and thought I had found it but I got home, opened it up and took a bite without paying much attention and it had DISGUSTING Coconut in it. Trust me when I say that gluten free people have their absolute FILL of two flavors in every other thing they eat - almond and coconut - and I absolutely do NOT want it in my ice cream too."

Also, sometimes the chips are in the caramel and sometimes they’re in the chocolate?? Confusion! But I will always buy this flavor."

Caramel is so soft not too sweet. The chocolate ice cream are so creamy as the caramel ice cream and chocolate tidbits are just bonus that makes this ice cream the best.
55_bj,Sean84Irish,2019-09-23,4,Great tasting but faulty core,0,0,"This ice cream and mixture taste great. It's one of my favorite go tos. I would give it a 5 but the last couple times I've purchased this ice cream the core stops halfway through which is a little disappointing considering that the feature name of its series is ""core"""
55_bj,Mojitomami,2018-10-22,5,This flavor gives me life!!,0,0,"I was not impressed with Ben & Jerry's ice cream until I saw this flavor and its ingredients. From the first spoonful, I was in love!! The only drawback is that Karamel Sutra's hard to find in my city. So whenever I come across it, I usually buy at least four pints."
55_bj,EmmaD23,2018-08-10,4,Asking for a customer,0,0,We have a customer in our store who loves this flavour but has been saying that it is very soft in our freezing. After getting checks on the freezers they are fine and so are other Ben and jerry flavours but we are cursious if this is due to the soft middle.
55_bj,Dustybucket,2017-11-07,5,Karamel sutra.,0,0,"I love this flavor when I was able to find it I’m my local Walmart super Center but now I am not able to find it there. Your product locator just confirmed to me that it could not find it in my area . Please bring it back to Elkins,WV Walmart super Center."
55_bj,Kenz,2020-06-29,3,Was way better before changing,0,0,Not a huge fan of the new fudge chips on the caramel side. It was my favorite flavor before this addition. I enjoyed having one side of the icecream that was perfectly creamy with the chunks remaining on the chocolate side. Not nearly as good now.
55_bj,tshoreview,2020-01-08,5,Name speaks for itself!,0,0,Karamel Sutra is SO delish!

55_bj,Rhonda,2018-04-02,5,All time Favorite,0,0,I used to buy this regularly at the Giant Eagle stores in Ohio. I've not seen it in stock lately. I'm hoping the flavor doesn't drop into the graveyard.
55_bj,Jenny55,2017-05-23,3,Core or a Topping?,0,0,Disappointed that the Karamel Core was only a third of the way down the center of the pint. I expected it to be all the way through to the bottom.

56_bj,Chocluvr,2018-02-04,5,Don't ever stop making this Ice Cream flavor!!!,22,0,"This is by far one of the best Ben & Jerry's flavor ever created. I found this flavor in my supermarket a few weeks ago & being a chocoholic peanut butter fanatic I had to try it. A delightful swirl of ice creams,a rich chocolately and creamy peanut butter core , and tons of chocolate peanut butter cups!!! Keep up the good work Ben & Jerry's!!!"
56_bj,SusanR,2017-10-29,5,THE ABSOLUTE BEST,9,0,"It's hard to even find the words to describe how much I LOVE this ice cream. If ever it gets sent to the graveyard, I am not sure I would want to continue existing on such a cruel planet. Please, please, please never get rid of PEANUT BUTTER FUDGE CORE!"
56_bj,LitaLo,2018-06-14,5,Peanut Butter delight,4,0,I have been buying this guy over and over. My freezer is always stocked with this flavor. The only bad thing Ihave to say is that not all contents of containers are created alike. Some have a lot of pb cups and some others lack those mini peanut butter cups that I love so much. I wish for more pb cups and less fudge core. Otherwise this is perfection
56_bj,Wizkid,2018-10-14,5,The BEST Peanut Butter/Chocolate combo ice cream,2,0,"I’m not a huge ice cream eater EXCEPT for this one! The PB Fudge Core strikes the perfect balance of both the peanut butter and chocolate to create a heavenly pint of pure yumminess.
My only complaint is that it is getting harder to find! It has been unseated by more weak-kneed, lower calorie, younger siblings. They can only DREAM of being this good."
56_bj,FuzzyGut,2018-06-03,5,OMG!!,2,0,"I just crushed my first pint of this one and WOW, I may have a new favorite flavor! Everything is amazing from the ice cream flavors to the mini cups and the core. It’s really a triumph of Ben And Jerry’s research and development, truth be told! Buy this, eat it and be happy!"
56_bj,chocho22,2018-04-16,5,Chocolate and Peanut Heaven,2,0,I bought the Peanut Butter Fudge Core yesterday and the moment the ice cream touched my tongue I was in heaven. This ice cream is now one of my favorite ice creams ever!! Thank you for creating this ice cream.
56_bj,Brittbrat,2019-03-11,2,Lacking,3,1,I eat ice cream for the yummy things that are in it (pieces of peanutbutter cups in this case) unfortunately I might have had in total 1 whole peanutbutter in the entire pint. Very disappointed as I love peanutbutter cups but with so very little in it I don't think I'll be getting this one again.
56_bj,slogirl,2018-11-15,3,Could be better,7,8,"I have bought this 3 times now, so you could say I'm a fan. I love the two different ice-cream flavors, but the core tastes fake and processed to me. I was hoping that maybe I just got a bad batch but now that my third one tastes the same I think this is the real flavor. Re-invent the core flavor and this would be a 5-star."
56_bj,Lyss24,2019-03-13,5,New favorite flavor,1,0,I bought this today after trying the cookie dough core pint which was highly disappointing. This one is 1000 times better and my new flavor. Two things I would change- more pb cups because when are there too many pb cups?? And the core didn't go all the way down
56_bj,TreeDancer,2018-01-28,5,"Holy cow, so good",1,0,"I wasn't expecting something this satisfying, it's perfectly balanced and no peanut butter cup will ever be worth it ever again, this ice cream has ruined me for any other brand."

56_bj,Sanford,2018-08-29,5,The Best Flavor,0,0,"This is my favorite ice cream flavor -- if this is in the store, I will never walk out with another flavor. If they don't have it, sometimes I'll walk another block to check another store or two. It's that good. Great balance, so it feels very rich instead and never too sweet. Both sides of the ice cream are equally compelling, so there are no disappointing bites. I hope this flavor sticks around for a long long time."
56_bj,Marley,2019-08-14,5,Awesome Flavor,0,0,"I can eat peanut butter, but I'm not a huge fan. In the store one day, they were out of my favorite (Half Baked). One of the few remaining flavors on the shelf, I bought the Peanut Butter Fudge Core. This stuff is so addictive, and I just can't get enough. I love the fudge core, and I love the tiny peanut butter cups. It's a perfect blend of flavors and textures. Beyond YUM!"
56_bj,Shellyshellzs,2020-04-30,5,Peanut butter fudge heaven,0,0,Oh man I use to be a whatever was on sale girl but my now fiance brand me this ice cream when I wasn't feeling good and it quickly became my favorite. It's is the perfect combination. It hit the spot when you get the craving. I am always in the look out. I since tried other flavor. I'm found of fish food but this is delicious....please sell more shoprite in linden NJ lol
56_bj,Or1234,2020-02-24,5,The best Chocolate Ice Cream Combo,0,0,This is the first chocolate ice cream I’ve tried and actually liked. The peanut butter cups and the combination of all the flavors along with the smooth core texture makes for a dreamy ice cream!
